Jeremy discusses Japan's special place in all this and wonders how the world's monetary authorities can put the long-term inflation genie back in the bottle.\n\nIn the UK, inflation and government borrowing were higher than expected, making it a bad week for Rachel Reeves. But at least we have rejoined the EU (well, agreed to agree with them about a few things).\n\nDespite all this, the UK market remained in a decent mood with small and mid-cap stocks outperforming large-cap stocks.\n\nGareth discusses updates and results from Forterra, IDOX and SDI Group.   \n\nNext week, some US Q1 GDP data is widely expected to show a sharp decline in activity.\n\nHowever, investors' main focus is likely to remain on the long end of the bond market and how to avoid the impact of FX and bond volatility.",

We feel that they should take some advice on how Argentina has coped with its much greater inflation problem over the last 12 months!\n\nBrought to you by Progressive Equity.",

His approach involves embracing convexity\u2014purchasing pockets of inexpensive volatility as a form of insurance against adverse outcomes in uncertain environments.\n\nWhen should investors adopt this strategy? According to David, the answer is simple: always\u2014just like insuring a house.\n\nDavid holds strong and often contrarian views that challenge the foundational assumptions of Modern Portfolio Theory, which he refers to as \"Sharpe World.\" In his view, this framework wrongly equates risk with volatility.\n\nHe brings these ideas to life through vivid anecdotes and illustrative examples that highlight the risks investors unknowingly take in markets shaped by Sharpe World principles and operated by what he calls \"Rational Accounting Man.\"",

    "description": "Headline grabbing Trump noise from Washington has died down but with concerns around tariffs, and issues in the Ukraine and the Middle East still not settled, Jeremy and Gareth discuss the common theme this week which has been central bankers and companies talking about trade related uncertainty.\n\nOverall the forecasts of GDP growth in the major economies in the world are coming down, but inflation expectations remain heightened. Big US corporates such as Nike and FedEx cited trade uncertainty as a major issue and it\u2019s been referenced increasingly in UK RNS announcements.\n\nWith US focus seemingly now more on longer term interest rates than the level of the US stock market, overriding market sentiment is one of capital flight from the US to the rest of the world. A survey documenting the capital allocation intentions of the world's largest asset managers listed the biggest one month allocation away from US equities ever recorded. Some has gone to Germany and the wider European market, some has gone into China and there's also been a big allocation into US treasuries. Although there's no direct evidence of much of this capital finding its way into the UK market yet, Jeremy and Gareth remain hopeful!\n\nIn the UK, Gareth talks about Beeks (BKS) and FDM who both had results. Employment data this week was pretty much as expected. However UK government borrowing data was running ahead of expectations,which doesn\u2019t bode well for next week's Spring Statement and the brewing government dispute about whether they should continue to look to raise taxes or to reduce government spending.\n\nNext week we have UK inflation data on Wednesday, and on Friday we get US PCE data (the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation measure).",

This leads to discussion of the US, where the OTC is generating real interest, and Singapore, where the authorities are actively promoting local investment and local listings.\n\nNext week is jobs week in the USA...fingers crossed that all is well.",

    "description": "This week, Gareth and Jeremy catch up on the week that marked one full month since Trump's return to the White House.\n\nFollowing JD Vance's lecture to Europe in Munich, the US initiated peace talks with Russia in Riyadh. This confirmed that the old world order has moved to a new one involving power projection by strong men operating in their own economic and strategic interests. Europe, the UN, and NATO are not involved.\n\nStarmer's meeting with Trump will be a career-defining event for him and a pivotal opportunity for the UK as a potential bridge between the US and the rest of Europe at this critical juncture for the West.\n\nIt also represents Trump's desire to tidy up Ukraine and Gaza to get to his main match-up, the strongman heavyweight contest between the US and China. \n\nXi has been boosting China's stock market and technology sector through a symbolic handshake with Jack Ma at a conference this week. The pair infamously fell out in 2021, with Ma disappearing from public view for a few years.   \n\nAlibaba shares and the wider Chinese stock market have performed much better than the US Mag Seven over the last month but remain well below their peak values of 4 years ago.\n\nGold had another strong week, and Trump says he is going to Fort Knox to check that the gold is still there. Gold and real assets have become more central to investor options as bonds have lost their appeal as risk-off assets in a more inflationary world.\n\nJapan records much higher inflation, which seems to require much higher rates. However, the yen carry trade worries of last summer have not recurred.\n\nIn the UK, there remains mixed economic data, but, on balance, there is less likelihood of significantly lower rates soon as inflation trends up for the next few months.     \n\nGareth runs through the week in company news, with caution from Thruvision and Zoo Digital and positive updates from Oxford Metrics, Beeks and Springfield Property.\n\nThe main event will be the German election on Sunday, which will have consequences for wider European politics, but don't expect things to happen quickly. \n\nThere are some US GDP and PCE inflation data, but the headlines will likely remain dominated by politics, with Starmer's trip to DC and Trump checking his gold reserves in Texas.",

He also considers small-cap silicon play, Ensilica (ENSI), a real tech company with the wrong balance sheet. Share price movements following announcements and forecast revisions suggest that the investors and wider market have a better idea of how the semiconductor industry works than the brokers.",

After shocking the world with his suggestion of turning Gaza into the Riveria of the Middle East, Trump has moved on to Ukraine. Such events illustrate how the accepted World order has broken down. Where is the UN in all of this?\n\nOne outcome has been a new all-time high in the gold price, indicating heightened risks and uncertainties for global investors. The US inflation data also came in hot. Yet, counter-intuitively, it didn't dent the gold bull market, indicating perhaps investor concerns over policy errors or breakdown in the relationship between the Treasury and the Fed.\n\nRelative to other monetary metals, gold looks expensive, and silver or platinum might offer better opportunities to protect against fiat money debasement. Not advice; do your own research. \n\nChina's equity values have recovered strongly after the Deep Seek AI revelations. Alibaba's stock has risen over 40% in less than a month, indicating the impact of the dispersal trade.\n\nThe UK economy unexpectedly grew in Q4 last year. While negative sentiment surrounds the economy, UK assets remain relatively attractive to global investors.\n\nThis week, one example of how the UK government prioritises economic growth is emerging in the newsflow of the motor finance and retail sectors.\n\nWith significant exposure to car loans, Close Brothers and SU made constructive updates this week, indicating that motor finance might avoid the protracted drag on consumer lending that PPI became. \n\nGareth covers the impact of government policy on Progressive clients Secure Trust Bank and Vertu Motors.   \n\nLooking ahead, we will get UK inflation data next week, which is likely to indicate a flat annual rate of 2.5%. \n\nAlso, we get Japanese inflation data, and the accompanying risk of the yen carry-trade unwind.",

They discuss selected UK company news and let us know what to look out for in the week ahead\u2026 \n\nThe pair muse on Trump's tariff-based discussions with various world leaders, with Xi Jinping (the obvious and most dangerous outlier) adding a bit of Chinese spice to the mix, with some largely unreported moves.  Alastair describes the UK building stocks, and their reaction to the Bank of England's rate cut, as well as some (good and bad) fundamental drivers of sector activity. \n\n\nGareth Evans has 25 years\u2019 research experience covering the Technology sector. An Oxford University graduate, Gareth qualified as an accountant before starting his research career covering the Pan European Chemicals sector at the American Investment Bank Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette (DLJ), later acquired by Credit Suisse. He then moved to cover the Technology sector at ABN AMRO, Canaccord and at Investec for eleven years, where he was Joint Head of Research. Gareth has received numerous awards for his work, including being voted techMark Analyst of the Year.\n\n\nAlastair Stewart has almost 35 years of experience covering the Property and Construction sector, encompassing UK, European and Emerging Market stocks. He previously worked as a research analyst at Investec and Dresdner Kleinwort, amongst other institutions. Prior to this, he spent twelve years as a financial journalist covering the construction sector.  Known for his outspoken views, Alastair is often invited to speak at industry events and sits on the influential Experian Construction Forecasting panel. He writes a regular column in Property Week, and his former career as a property journalist helps him to uncover investment and news opportunities that others have missed.",

Where does it sit and what opportunities do you see going forward? \n\n06:02 - You clearly have strong access to capital and a healthy balance sheet to support the active M&A pipeline.  Can you talk more about acquisition opportunities?\n\n06:44 - You have recently resegmented the group and introduced a very clear mandate to grow the business both via organic growth and acquisition. Can you tell us more about how this is progressing? \n \n07:30 - Can you expand on any of the operational efficiency initiatives to support margin growth?\n\n08:05 - What are the benefits for portfolio companies, being part of SDI Group? Why would a management team decide to sell their business to SDI? \n\n08:56 - We\u2019ve touched on what sets SDI apart as a preferred buyer but some of your recent acquisitions have given you a broader geographic reach also. Can you say anymore about further geographic expansion opportunities?\n\n09:28 - Just to finish off with the conundrum between M&A and organic growth, can you just end with your thoughts on this and any closing comments on SDI?\n\nSDl Group is an AIM-quoted group specialising in the acquisition and development of a portfolio of companies that design and manufacture niche analytical technology products for use within digital imaging and sensing and control applications in science, technology and medical markets. The group operates a well-established 'buy and build' strategy, supplementing organic growth with earnings-accretive acquisitions of complementary businesses that have sustainable profits and cash flows. Targets are primarily UK businesses with established reputations, capable of achieving significant organic growth through developing export markets. SDI Group takes a decentralised approach, with seasoned local management given broad discretion to run group businesses within defined limits. SDI Group typically acquires businesses generating up to \u00a31m EBIT for around 4-6 times EBIT plus net assets, including earnout payments.",

DSW Capital operates licensing arrangements with its businesses and has over 130 fee earners across 12 offices in the UK. These businesses trade primarily under the Dow Schofield Watts and DR Solicitors brands.\n\nDSW Capital's vision is for our brands to become the most sought-after destinations for ambitious, entrepreneurial professionals to start and develop their own businesses. Through a licensing model, DSW Capital gives professionals the autonomy and flexibility to fulfil their potential.\n\nBeing part of the DSW Capital group brings support benefits in recruitment, funding and infrastructure. DSW Capital's challenger model attracts experienced, senior professionals, predominantly with a \"Big 4\" accounting firm or \"Magic Circle\" legal background, who want to launch their own businesses and recognise the value of DSW Capital's brands and the synergies which come from being part of the network.\n\nDSW Capital aims to scale its agile model through organic growth, geographical expansion, additional service lines and acquisitions. The Directors are targeting high margin, complementary, niche service lines with a strong synergistic fit with the existing network.",

Originally established in 2002, by three KPMG alumni, DSW is one of the first platform models disrupting the traditional model of accounting professional services firms. DSW operates licensing arrangements with 25 licensee businesses with 107 fee earners, eleven offices across the UK. These trade primarily under the Dow Schofield Watts brand.\n\nDSW's vision is for the DSW Network to become the most sought-after destination for ambitious, entrepreneurial professionals to start and develop their own businesses. Through a licensing model, DSW gives professionals the autonomy and flexibility to fulfil their potential. Being part of the DSW Network brings support benefits in recruitment, funding and infrastructure. DSW's challenger model attracts experienced, senior professionals, predominantly with a \"Big 4\" accounting firm background, who want to launch their own businesses and recognise the value of the Dow Schofield Watts brand and the synergies which come from being part of the DSW Network.\n\nDSW aims to scale its agile model through organic growth, geographical expansion, additional service lines and investing in \"Break Outs\" (existing teams in larger firms). The Directors are targeting high margin, complementary, niche service lines with a strong synergistic fit with the existing DSW Network.",

    "description": "Bill Fawkner-Corbett, Head of SIGnet, takes us through his journey of discovering Compounders and the reasons for investing in them. He gives one example of a mistake he made selling Microsoft, which made him realise he had no effective tool for valuing Compounders. In his subsequent reading, he discovered the Graham Formula, which gave him a method for calculating the PE ratio for a company based on growth. This set him on a search for alternative methods that would take account of other metrics (e.g. return on capital) in the PE calculation; his explanation of what he found is fascinating. \n\nAlthough all the examples he gives in the presentation are US shares, the majority of Bill's portfolio is in UK shares \u2013 he stresses that more than a few of these he considers to be Compounders. \n\nThis is a presentation Bill gave to his SIGnet group and is an example of the material that might be covered by your local SIGnet - Serious Investor Group Network.  SIGnet groups of private investors meet regularly to discuss shares and investing strategies to benefit their investing performance.  At the end of the video, and below, there are more details of SIGnet and how to find your local group.  https://www.sharesoc.org/signet/\n\n00:00 - Opener\n00:18 - Introduction \n01:33 - Bill's background\n02:44 - Characteristics of a compounder\n07:02 - Market value VS Intrinsic Value\n08:38 - The PEG method\n12:45 - The Graham Formula\n13:39 - Margin of safety & Internal rate of return\n16:48 - Growth & value creation\n18:30 - Cost of capital & ROCE\n20:36 - Credit Suisse Method\n24:44 - Recent examples\n27:59 - About SIGnet\n29:46 - How to join SIGnet\n\nBill\u2019s professional experience for the past 30 years has been in Private Equity and Corporate Finance in Central & Eastern Europe. \n\nHe has been a private investor for around 50 years, initially in Investment Trusts, Unit Trusts and ETFs; since 2008 in individual shares. \n\nIn early 2020 he joined SIGnet, a national network of private investor groups. He became Head of SIGnet in May 2023. His presentation is a compilation of presentations he has recently given to SIGnet groups. \n\nTo join SIGnet, or just to find out more, go to: https://www.sharesoc.org/signet/",

DSW now operates licensing arrangements with 25 licensee businesses with 106 fee earners, from 12 offices across the UK.

It is estimated that washing machines contribute 35% of the 171 trillion microplastic particles in the ocean.\n\nA range of actors, including consumers, the media NGOs and regulators are exerting pressure on these industries, with legislative action beginning to be taken.\n\nXeros' three main technologies, Filtration, Finish, and Care, facilitate garment manufacturers, industrial laundries, domestic washing machine manufacturers and consumers, to reduce their environmental impact, whilst also significantly improving efficiency in the process.\n\nXeros' model is to generate revenue from licensing its technologies, generating royalties and the sale of consumables. Currently there are 8 agreements in place. The addressable markets in Filtration, Finish and Care are estimated to be valued at \u00a3350m p.a., \u00a3132m p.a. and \u00a33bn p.a. respectively.",

The first wines were released in 2010 to critical acclaim. Following additional vineyard plantings in 2013 and 2015 in both Kent and West Sussex, Gusbourne now has 93 hectares of mature vineyards. The NEST visitor centre was opened next to the winery in Appledore in 2017, providing tours, tastings and a direct outlet for our wines.\n\nRight from the beginning, Gusbourne's intention has always been to produce the finest English sparkling wines. Starting with carefully chosen sites, we use best practice in establishing and maintaining the vineyards and conduct green harvests to ensure we achieve the highest quality grapes for each vintage. A quest for excellence is at the heart of everything we do. We blind taste hundreds of samples before finalising our blends and even after the wines are bottled, they spend extended time on their lees to add depth and flavour. Once disgorged, extra cork ageing further enhances complexity. Our winemaking process remains traditional, but one that is open to innovation where appropriate. It takes four years to bring a vineyard into full production and a further four years to transform those grapes into Gusbourne's premium sparkling wine.\n\nGusbourne's luxury brand enjoys premium price positioning and is distributed in the finest establishments both in the UK and abroad. Our wines can be found in leading luxury retailers, restaurants, hotels and stockists, always being aware that where we are says a lot about who we are.",

The first wines were released in 2010 to critical acclaim. Following additional vineyard plantings in 2013 and 2015 in both Kent and West Sussex, Gusbourne now has 93 hectares of mature vineyards. The NEST visitor centre was opened next to the winery in Appledore in 2017, providing tours, tastings and a direct outlet for our wines.\n\nRight from the beginning, Gusbourne's intention has always been to produce the finest English sparkling wines. Starting with carefully chosen sites, we use best practice in establishing and maintaining the vineyards and conduct green harvests to ensure we achieve the highest quality grapes for each vintage. A quest for excellence is at the heart of everything we do. We blind taste hundreds of samples before finalising our blends and even after the wines are bottled, they spend extended time on their lees to add depth and flavour. Once disgorged, extra cork ageing further enhances complexity. Our winemaking process remains traditional, but one that is open to innovation where appropriate. It takes four years to bring a vineyard into full production and a further four years to transform those grapes into Gusbourne's premium sparkling wine.\n\nGusbourne's luxury brand enjoys premium price positioning and is distributed in the finest establishments both in the UK and abroad. Our wines can be found in leading luxury retailers, restaurants, hotels and stockists, always being aware that where we are says a lot about who we are.",

Originally established in 2002, by three KPMG alumni, DSW is one of the first platform models disrupting the traditional model of accounting professional services firms. DSW operates licensing arrangements with 20 licensee businesses with 97 fee earners, across seven offices in England and three in Scotland. These trade primarily under the Dow Schofield Watts brand.\n\nDSW's vision is for the DSW Network to become the most sought-after destination for ambitious, entrepreneurial professionals to start and develop their own businesses. Through a licensing model, DSW gives professionals the autonomy and flexibility to fulfil their potential. Being part of the DSW Network brings support benefits in recruitment, funding and infrastructure. DSW's challenger model attracts experienced, senior professionals, predominantly with a \"Big 4\" accounting firm background, who want to launch their own businesses and recognise the value of the Dow Schofield Watts brand and the synergies which come from being part of the DSW Network.\n\nDSW aims to scale its agile model through organic growth, geographical expansion, additional service lines and investing in \"Break Outs\" (existing teams in larger firms). The Directors are targeting high margin, complementary, niche service lines with a strong synergistic fit with the existing DSW Network.",

Our Rail Technology and Services Division has won several multi-year software contracts, and in Data, Analytics, Consultancy and Events we have seen a strong post-Covid recovery in activity levels.\n\nWe have a growing pipeline of opportunities in both Divisions, and we have expanded our addressable markets including our first direct entry into the large and growing North America rail market with the acquisition of RailComm. The post-acquisition performance of this business has been particularly pleasing, with good revenue and profit performance, new orders secured for its core products, and an encouraging level of interest in products from elsewhere in the Group that are already well established in the UK. These opportunities leave us well placed to deliver further growth.\n\nThe UK rail industry's transition to a new Great British Railways structure is ongoing and the overall objective is to create a data-driven, customer-focused, safety-critical future for the industry. Digital transformation will play a significant role in the industry's transition and our range of rail technology products and services is well-placed to help the rail industry deliver operational performance improvements and efficiency savings.\nWe continue to invest in implementing a more integrated operating model to help us to execute our growth strategy. I was particularly pleased to see the launch of the OneTracsis leadership development programme during the year, which is an important initiative as part of our commitment to investing in developing our people and growing the next generation of leaders in our business. We are also making good progress in implementing a single groupwide IT operating model, under the direction of an experienced technology leader who has been recruited to further enhance senior management bandwidth.\n\nTracsis is fully committed to delivering sustainable growth that benefits the communities in which we, and our customers, operate. The Group's products and services are well aligned with this vision, and support our customers in delivering positive environmental and social outcomes. This year we have formalised our sustainability strategy and set ourselves the ambition of being carbon neutral by 2030 for scope 1 and scope 2 emissions from Tracsis operations.\n\nQ1 trading is in line with the Board's expectations. We are confident that there are strong growth prospects for all parts of our Group and therefore remain committed to implementing our overall strategic growth and investment plans. We will continue to pursue organic and acquisitive growth supported by a strong balance sheet.\"\n\n00:00 Opening\n\nChris Barnes, CEO\n00:17 Introduction\n00:54 About Tracsis\n02:15 FY22 highlights\n04:59 Operational improvements\n\nAndy Kelly, CFO\n08:11 Financial highlights\n09:57 Revenue\n13:18 Income statement\n15:25 Cashflow\n\nChris Barnes, CEO\n17:11 Growth strategy update\n18:55 Operational performance software\n21:06 Remote condition monitoring\n22:51 Smart ticketing & delay repay\n24:02 Risk management/safety software\n25:06 Data analytics & GIS\n\nAndy Kelly, CFO\n26:20 North America\n28:01 Growth opportunities\n30:59 Addressable market\n31:46 ESG\n\nChris Barnes, CEO\n33:14 Outlook \u2013 Rail\n36:05 Outlook \u2013 Smart ticketing\n37:36 Conclusion\n38:53 Q&A\n\nDemonstration videos of the Group's TRACS Enterprise, Remote Condition Monitoring, Smart Ticketing, and Safety and Risk Management rail technology products are available to view here: https://tracsis.com/investors/investors-day/rail-technology-product-demonstration-for-investors/\n\nTracsis plc is a United Kingdom-based technology company engaged in providing software and hardware products, and consultancy services for the rail industry.

Commissioned specialist research indicated that the Company improved its market share in the Period, and new customers have also been secured within the multiple retailers / larger customers space. All of this provides a high degree of confidence that the Company's strategy of driving additional revenue opportunities from a more efficient and modernised operating base and improving the service offering to all customers is the right one .

Looking ahead, it remains difficult to forecast with real authority how the current year will play out but we are continuing to stabilise the business post the pandemic and its effects, and see the scope for a return to accelerated contract awards as and when a more normalised operating environment returns. In the meantime, we take great confidence in the strength of our offering, which is differentiated by our technical capability, proven ability to innovate and continue to perform under extraordinarily challenging circumstances, and by our attractive pricing, particularly where we self-perform.\n\nAs we execute on our plans, our main priorities for this year are to grow the pipeline, particularly with US federal Government departments, build balance sheet liquidity, and drive value from recent investment in our business, systems and processes. We thank shareholders for their patience over what has been a challenging period and we look forward to realising the value from supporting our customers as they emerge from the residual challenges of the last two years.\"\n\n00:00 \u2013 Opening\n\nSoraya Narfeldt, CEO\n00:17 \u2013 Introduction\n00:23 \u2013 Agenda\n00:33 \u2013 Results overview\n01:42 \u2013 Looking ahead\n\nAndrew Bolter, CFO\n02:43 \u2013 Financial headlines\n03:14 \u2013 Income statement\n04:23 \u2013 Cash flow and balance sheet\n05:17 \u2013 Update on Mozambique\n06:53 - Liquidity position\n\nLars Narfeldt, COO\n07:25 \u2013 Overview by service channel\n08:45 \u2013 FY21 Order book\n09:46 \u2013 Pipeline\n10:32 \u2013 Sector overview\n11:56 \u2013 Strategic focus\n\nSoraya Narfeldt, CEO\n12:54 \u2013 RA Federal Services\n16:39 \u2013 Value creation roadmap\n17:38 \u2013 Summary and outlook\n\n18:29 \u2013 Q&A\n\nRA International Group PLC is a United Kingdom-based remote site service provider.

The investors seek to unearth a hidden gem, which the Fund Managers haven't heard of or have overlooked.

    "description": "Here, Larry Zulch discusses the implications of the massive increase in energy prices, together with the Ukraine \u2013 Russia conflict to drive the transformation to alternative energy; and what that means for the sector and specifically Invinity.\n\nLong duration energy storage (LDES) will be integral to the alternative energy transition.  Here Larry explains more about vanadium flow batteries, and other options.  LDES will be a \u00a310+ billion market, where Infinity, through the partnership with Siemens Gemesa, target 10% market share by 2030, and providing over 100 GWh during the next 5-8 years.  Funding for this will be supported by Governments around the world, in particular, the USA and Germany accelerating their energy transition.  \n\nThe race is on for this to happen quickly.  For Invinity, expect news on the Siemens Gemesa product and commercialisation early next year.\n\n00::00 Start\n00:48  Is the accelerating cost of oi and gas driving the transition to renewable energy and who will be the winners?\n03:50  What are the options for long duration energy storage (LDES)?\n05:03  Lithium batteries versus vanadium flow batteries?  \n06:34  Hydrogen and sodium versus vanadium flow batteries?\n09:09  Advantages of Vanadium flow batteries\n10:04  What is happening in the USA with Biden\u2019s Infrastructure Bill?  \n11:08 Something talked about is the frequency response companies exploiting the energy situation supplying the grid using old gas and diesel engines.  How much is this happening?  \n12:46  With the current economic situation, we can see a major move to bring battery metal supply back to the west, does this impact the battery supply chain and of course the LDES situation?\n14:42  Does anyone control the source of vanadium, and will demand push the price up?\n16:48  How big is the market for long duration energy storage, and what percentage is likely to be taken by vanadium flow batteries?\n21:38  How quickly can the renewable energy transition be accelerated, can we get supply on stream within the short term?\n23:31 How important to IES is the UK Government award to develop a 40mw project with Pivot Power and EDF?  Who else is involved?  \n28:02  Progress with the Siemens Gemesa joint development project.\n30:16  The best geographies for IES production and supply?\n32:00  How easy is it to take production from 30 MWh to multiple GWhs?\n\n\nInvinity Energy Systems PLC, formerly Redt Energy Plc, is a jersey-based vanadium flow battery company. The Company\u2019s vanadium flow batteries are a form of non-degrading energy storage, already deployed and a key alternative to conventional lithium-ion batteries. The vanadium flow batteries are a form of heavy-duty, stationary energy storage, used primarily in high-utilization applications such as being coupled with industrial scale solar generation for distributed, low-carbon energy projects. Its flow batteries store energy in a non-flammable, liquid electrolyte, held in tanks within a self-contained module. Its storage markets are Europe, North America, Asia, Australasia and Africa.",

    "description": "Richard talks through the thrills and spills of his year.  Up 42.5% at his high, and still up over 30% when we spoke, now, probably higher with National World #NWOR reporting ahead of expectations on 16th December, a day after recording.  A brilliant performance but not everything went to plan.  As always, Richard gives us some great nuggets, take profits when your weighting goes above your comfort threshold; weight your position size according to the market cap, and he observes, the top holdings are where you make your money, the bottom is where you get whiplashed.  His main learning of the year is to have more patience.  \n\nRichard may be long or short any companies mentioned, please do your own research.\n\n00:00  Start\n00:58  Richard\u2019s year to date performance\n02:24  What went badly: Synthoma #SYNT\n13:17  What went well?  Polar Capital #POLR\n17:47  Made.com #MADE\n28:33  Best performer: Reach #RCH  35:37  National World #NWOR\n37:22  UP Global Sourcing #UPGS; Macfarlane #MACF & Devro #DVO\n39:57  Bloomsbury #BMY\n43:39  IPOs and liquidity/illiquidity \n44:40  Has the macro picture changed your stock selection criteria?\n49:33  AB Foods #ABF; Homeserve #HSV\n50:45  Cash\n52:45  Santa rally\n53:39  Seraphine #BUMP\n59:40  Wincanton #WIN\n01:01 52  Will the FTSE100 close up, down or flat by 15th December 2022?\n\nRichard\u2019s background in his own words:\n\nMy interest in the London stock market came about in the early 80\u2019s \u2013 working over the summer holidays whilst at college, as a post boy \u2013 leading to being somewhat of a gofer for a man called Zimmerman, who help build Mercury Asset Management in the 1980s. The taste of the moving parts of the City gave me my first real joy of City life \u2013 and I loved it.\n\n1986 \u2013 joined Lazard Brothers (via the back door) as a Trust Accountant, valuing and doing the daily book-keeping for investment trusts/unit trusts. Had my chance to move to the front office in 1988 as an assistant fund manager on the bond the international desks. Met my first real mentor John Innes, helping to manage and win major international global accounts \u2013 flying around the world in my mid 20\u2019s.\n\nRealised the real way to learn the skills needed to manage money was via mentors \u2013 very good ones. My real passion is to manage money invested directly in stocks and shares \u2013 where I saw the excitement and thrills \u2013 and having the belief I could make serious money. Passed my analyst and other professional exams then had the chance to join a real modern-day investment legend \u2013 Richard Smith \u2013 becoming his no.2 on the Lazard UK Small Companies desk. Over the following 5 years gained the opportunity to build the investment style foundation stones \u2013 I still follow today.\n\nThe importance of skilled mentors \u2013 is the real key to the success of any young professional \u2013 especially in the investment world. True 30 years ago \u2013 true today.\n\n1997 \u2013 left Lazard to join the sell-side (stockbroking), Chaterhouse \u2013 specialising in small and mid-cap UK companies. An amazing experience, helping to take a mid-ranking firm to No1.\n\n2001 \u2013 sold my soul to Merill Lynch.\n\n2005 \u2013 returned to the buy-side with Cazenove to help run the UK-focused hedge funds \u2013 mixing my stock-picking skills to their business cycle style. Ended up with about \u00a31.5billion of funds to manage and becoming one of the most successful performing UK hedge funds in the UK in that period, especially the GFC.\n\n2010 \u2013 left Cazenove to join Trium \u2013 a private family wealth office \u2013 managing our own money \u2013 no clients \u2013 simply an absolute returned focused approach. Long \u2013 short. And both short and long-term objectives and managing my own pa. money alongside.",

    "description": "Jeremy gives us his views on the \u2018hypernormal\u2019 economic world we are living in today; taken from the Adam Curtis documentary, \u2018HyperNormalisation\u2019. (https://youtu.be/AUiqaFIONPQ).  Jeremy speaks like an economic historian, drawing from different eras of different economic policies.  We discuss QE and monetary policy, which he feels has neutered the banking industry.  With inflation, he draws analogies with the 40s and 50s rather than the 70s.  Jeremy gives his view where he\u2019s investing his own money, accepting investors are being asked to take more risk to see a return on their savings.  He favours equities, especially compounders with good free cash flow.  Google is the largest position in his portfolio.  However, he believes all portfolios deserve some real asset exposure, he holds single Scotch Malt Whiskey and bitcoin!  We discuss today\u2019s innovators, where he cites of course Google, but at the smaller end, Aquis Exchange #AQX.  We close on his views of 'value' versus 'growth' investing.  Bubbling with brilliance, educational and entertaining.\n\n00:00  Start\n00:51  Jeremy\u2019s background\n05:24  QE & monetary policy\n13:30  Inflation\n20:15  Where should one invest today?\n24:43  What are your stock selection criteria? \n28:30  Where are you seeing innovation in companies and sectors today? \n32:47  Process innovation: Aquis Exchange #AQX\n35:03  The role of the bank or broker\u2019s effect on the cost of capital for a company and their market value\n40.25  Owner managed businesses\n43:57  Today, are you a value or growth investor?\n52:15  About Jeremy\u2019s podcast: In the company of Mavericks\n55:09  Where to find Jeremy\n\nJeremy on Linkedin: www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-mckeown-33b962a/\n\nJeremy's websites: \nwww.hypernormaltimes.com  \nwww.inthecompanyofmavericks.com\n\nDowgate wealth: https://dowgatewealth.co.uk/our-team/jeremy-mckeown/\n\nAbout Jeremy:\nJeremy has worked in the UK equity market for four decades, he has met and interacted with all types of investors. He has met countless companies and read widely on different investment topics. He has invested in a variety of companies and implemented differing strategies, sometimes successfully, other times disastrously. He is now looking to use his experience, knowledge and world view to make better decisions about his own investments. He would also like to help other investors and companies to make better decisions about the world we inhabit, to learn and disseminate new ideas, avoid unnecessary risk and hopefully to help keep a positive perspective on what at times appears to be a chaotic and dysfunctional place.",

He has served on both public and private boards, as well as having worked in private equity and been a FTSE-100 CFO. He is currently a non-executive director at Dentsu Group Inc (a Japanese-based global media company) and Watkin Jones plc (a listed UK property company). Previously, he has chaired Assura plc, Flybe Group plc and Hozelock Group, and served as a non-executive on Quintain Estates & Development plc, Aegis Group plc, Mitchells & Butlers plc, and Northern Rock plc (as part of the rescue team). His early career stretched from being a milkman, working in a post-room, to being a store manager and CFO at Safeway plc.\n\nSimon is passionate about making boards work better, for directors to learn from their own and others\u2019 mistakes, for greater diversity at all layers of management, but especially in the boardroom, and for regulators to participate in helping boards make better decisions (instead of taking pot shots from the sidelines).\n\nContact Simon through his website: http://www.simonlaffin.com/",

Firstly, they should make profit and have positive free cashflow, then he describes his four pillars, including their superiority through brand and reputation, then, what he describes as architecture, having the structures in place to operate in any environment; innovation to keep ahead, and strategic assets which make them untouchable.  To illustrate, he picks companies with these qualities.  He then goes on to give wise advice from his own mistake and gives a view on current markets.

After cutting his teeth on anything from potash mines in Spain to launching a low cost carrier for BA, he moved to Hoare Govett in 1999 in its TMT equity research team, just before the dot com bubble started to expand. After it duly popped, he emerged somewhat wiser from the experience and worked for ten years on the sell side, ending up at Altium as a roving analyst. Since 2012, he has worked at Schroders and took on his first fund in 2015.",

Here, Richard Greenfield, Co-Founder of Tamesis Partners, specialists in global mining and natural resources, shares how newbies can evaluate mining stocks.\n\nThis is a fantastic overview that may require a few listens; everything from the market overview, where we\u2019re at in the cycle, to how to dip your toe into the sector.  Some great nuggets such as, \u2018mines are made, not found\u2019, the people are key; and he recommends that the mine should be large enough to attract institutional interest.  Of course, the investment hinges on NPV, IRR (greater than 20%); and as with all investments CAPEX, margins and returns.  \n\nRichard ends with three examples of mining sector stocks that he likes using the evaluation criteria outlined.  This is superb.  A sector not without risk, but with Richard\u2019s guidance, you should be better armed to understand those risks and the factors you need to evaluate.\n\n00:00  Start\n00:18  Introduction\n01:00  Richard\u2019s background & Tamesis Partners\n03:30  What\u2019s the composition of the global metals and mining industry?\n05:06  How important is London v other exchanges?\n07:00  Where should we look to make money in the current climate?\n09:53  Why have equities lagged commodity prices?\n10:45  Commodities are highly priced at the moment, will that continue? And what are the drivers?\n14:45  How do commodities and equities move with each other?\n18:17  What\u2019s the best way for a newbie to play the sector?\n22:39  When do you want to get into a mine?\n25:57  What makes a good mine and how do you value it?\n30:29  What is a good margin for a mine?\n32:48  What\u2019s the returns and success rate?\n37:57  What are the risks to look out for?\n40:41  Richard\u2019s picks of the sector for your further research:\n44:04  Tridant Royalties (TRR)\n50:04 Shanta Gold (SHG)\n55:07  Capital (CAPD)\n\nAbout Richard Greenfield\nRichard qualified as a chartered accountant with PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2003 before commencing an investment banking career in 2005, almost all of which has focused on the mining sector. While at Ambrian Partners Richard worked alongside Charlie Bendon as part of that firm\u2019s Extel #1 ranked mining team, acting as Nominated Adviser to a large portfolio of junior and mid-tier companies and concluding a wide range of IPO, secondary financing and M&A transactions. Richard joined GMP Securities Europe LLP as a partner in 2010 as part of a significant expansion of GMP\u2019s London operations, with a particular focus on dual and overseas listed companies and cross-border advisory transactions.\n\nwww.tamesispartners.com\nLinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/tamesis-partners-llp\nTamesis Partners research on Research Tree: www.research-tree.com/providers/tamesis-partners",

    "description": "Richard has doubled his money on a rolling twelve-month basis to July 2021.  Here, he gives his views on the markets, the economy, and where he sees opportunities.  He is positive on global equities, with caveats.  He saw August 2020 as the start of the business recovery, which he believes is still on course. He cautions to keep an eye on PMI/ISM data to see the continued growth.  He\u2019s bullish on industrial cyclicals due to government fiscal spending, citing  Kier.  Essentially, he\u2019s looking for companies with pricing power, strong brands and structural drivers.  Richard runs a concentrated portfolio of just 16 stocks, here he expands on some of his holdings and why he feels these investments will profit in the current environment.\n\nYou should assume Richard owns any shares he talks about so, of course DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH if they are of interest to you.  \n\n00:00  Opening\n00:50  Richards performance year to date\n01:25  Reach (RCH)\n02:00  The markets and economic background.  \n10:25  Reach (RCH)  \n14:18  Polar Capital (POLR)\n15:57  Redde Northgate (REDD)\n16:35  UP Global Sourcing (UPGS)\n17:05  Macfarlane (MACF)\n17:20  Synthoma (SYNT)\n18:00  Wickes (WIX)\n18:25  Novacyt (NCYT)\n23:51  Made.com (MADE)\n32:19  Devro (DVO)\n39:22  National World (NWOR)\n49:55  The government bond market\n\nPIWORLD videos are for information, education and interest only.  They do not constitute any kind of recommendation to buy a share in any company mentioned, do your own research.\n\nRichard's background in his own words:\n\nMy interest in the London stock market came about in the early 80\u2019s \u2013 working over the summer holidays whilst at college, as a post boy \u2013 leading to being somewhat of a gofer for a man called  Zimmerman, who help build Mercury Asset Management in the 1980s. The taste of the moving parts of the City gave me my first real joy of City life \u2013 and I loved it.\n\n1986 \u2013 joined Lazard Brothers (via the back door) as a Trust Accountant, valuing and doing the daily book-keeping for investment trusts/unit trusts. Had my chance to move to the front office in 1988 as an assistant fund manager on the bond the international desks. Met my first real mentor John Innes, helping to manage and win major international global accounts \u2013 flying around the world in my mid 20\u2019s.\n\nRealised the real way to learn the skills needed to manage money was via mentors \u2013 very good ones. My real passion is to manage money invested directly in stocks and shares \u2013 where I saw the excitement and thrills \u2013 and having the belief I could make serious money. Passed my analyst and other professional exams then had the chance to join a real modern-day investment legend \u2013 Richard Smith \u2013 becoming his no.2 on the Lazard UK Small Companies desk. Over the following 5 years gained the opportunity to build the investment style foundation stones \u2013 I still follow today.\n\nThe importance of skilled mentors \u2013 is the real key to the success of any young professional \u2013 especially in the investment world. True 30 years ago \u2013 true today.\n\n1997 \u2013 left Lazard to join the sell-side (stockbroking), Chaterhouse - specialising in small and mid-cap UK companies. An amazing experience, helping to take a mid-ranking firm to No1.\n\n2001 \u2013 sold my soul to Merill Lynch.\n\n2005 \u2013 returned to the buy-side with Cazenove to help run the UK-focused hedge funds \u2013 mixing my stock-picking skills to their business cycle style. Ended up with about \u00a31.5billion of funds to manage and becoming one of the most successful performing UK hedge funds in the UK in that period, especially the GFC.\n\n2010 \u2013 left Cazenove to join Trium \u2013 a private family wealth office \u2013 managing our own money \u2013 no clients \u2013 simply an absolute returned focused approach. Long \u2013 short. And both short and long-term objectives and managing my own pa. money alongside.",

They help us identify some of the red flags in company accounts, including where profits are flattered by either balance sheet assets which should appear as debits on the P&L, or with credits taken out of the balance sheet benefiting the P&L. Artfully, they take a dry subject, add some personality and humour so one learns and enjoys it!\n\nTim\u2019s background - 00:33\nAndy\u2019s involvement with The Signs Were There \u2013 01:30\nWhat do you look at first with a set of accounts? - 03:07\nAuditors - 09:30\nWhen is it appropriate to capitalise? - 11:11\nWhen is EBITDA an appropriate measure of profit? - 17:08\nHow easily can we understand a company's accounts with CV19 provisions/ adjustments? - 20:40\nHow do you distinguish between good & bad acquisitive companies? - 23:27\nAre high levels of debt ever appropriate to achieve shareholder returns? - 27:26\nAre you surprised the ease at which companies can raise funds with CV19? \u2013 28:40\nWill there be continued enthusiasm for capital raises? - 30:17\nAre you optimistic for the markets in 2021 and 2022? - 31:47\nESG - 33:52\n\nAbout Andy Brough:\n\u2022 Head of the UK & European Small and Mid Cap team \n\u2022 Manager of the Schroder Mid 250 Fund and the Schroder UK Smaller Companies Fund \n\u2022 Co-Manager of the Schroder UK Mid Cap Fund plc and Co-manager of the Schroder Institutional UK Smaller Companies Fund \n\u2022 Co-manager of Schroder ISF European Smaller Companies \n\u2022 Investment career commenced on joining Schroders in 1987 \n\u2022 Chartered Accountant \n\u2022 BSc in Economics, Manchester University\n\nAbout Tim Steer\nTim Steer toured with Meatloaf, Diana Ross, Cheap Trick, The Cars, Thin Lizzy and The Jam as a sound engineer, and managed the Pink Floyd\u2019s  old sound and lighting system after the release of The Wall. At the time it was one of the largest systems in  the  world. \n\nHe then embarked on a new career and qualified as a Chartered Accountant with EY and after leaving there he became a highly rated investment analyst at HSBC James Capel and then Merrill Lynch, where he was Managing Director and Head of Research of Pan Euro Small/Mid Cap Companies. He puts his success entirely down to the excellent training he received at EY, BPP and from a partner called Richard Findlater. \n\nIn 2000 he was a founding shareholder of New Star and in 2009 he joined Artemis where  he was part of the team that purchased the business back from Fortis, then part of RBS.

IMImobile (IMO) didn\u2019t go so well, selling out two weeks before their bid.  However, David is sanguine, and explains running a concentrated portfolio means you have to make choices, and sometimes that means you forgo opportunities.  He adds, running a shorter list you should get greater long term performance. Equally he points out, some shares can \u2018go to sleep\u2019, and it\u2019s important to remember why you bought in originally.  David\u2019s 2021 pick is Venture Life (VLG).   Although the chart looks weak, which David suggests might be due to a move to value, sales are up 50% this year, and he believes the 2021 forecasts are 'simply too low'.  \n\nDavid\u2019s performance ytd: +10% up 99% from the low \u2013 00:38\nWhat went well: Tremor (TRMR) - 02:50\nCodemasters (CDM) - 06:10\nWhat didn\u2019t go so well:  IMImobile (IMO) sold 2 weeks before the bid - 07:09\nWhat\u2019s David bullish about for 2021: Venture Life - 11:30\nWhere to find David and get your free issue of Growth Company Investor -15:19\n\nAbout David Thornton:\nFollowing an extensive career in the City David is Editor & Owner of Growth Company Investor (GCI), an excellent publication about Small Cap Shares.

He discusses, what has gone well and how to avoid value traps, advising don\u2019t buy a recovery stock unless it\u2019s rallied significantly, citing Volex (VLX). What didn\u2019t go so well and learnings, where he discusses Shoe Zone (SHOE).  Finally, he outlines the investing case for DX Group (DX.), which is his pick for 2020.  Full of wonderful analogies and humour, alongside some tremendous pearls of wisdom.  \n\nStephen joins Stellar Asset Management - 00:39\nStellar's performance to end November 2020, (which has gone up since!)  \u2013 01:23\nWhat\u2019s gone well: Volex (VLX) - 02:26\nWhat didn\u2019t go so well, and what did you learn from that: Shoe Zone (SHOE) \u2013 08:55\nTop pick for 2021: DX Group (DX.) - 12:00\n\nPrevious piworld videos with Stephen English: https://www.piworld.co.uk/category/stephen-english/\n\nAbout Stephen English \n\nStephen is Investment Director at Stellar Asset Management. He joined Stellar in September 2020, having previously worked at Blankstone Sington since 2002, where an early grounding on the dealing desk paved the way for a fascination with markets, how the \u2018invisible hand\u2019 of supply and demand could move prices and how efficient dealing can add value.\n\nWith a background in art (good drawer/awful painter) and an interest in psychology Stephen believes that small-cap investment is more art than science. An avid student of the market, he has authored his own 12-page investment philosophy which was well received by professional and retail readers alike. When it comes to the stockmarket, Stephen says \u2018when you find the key, they change the lock\u2019 which drives a zeal for continual improvement.\n\nNever one for fads, increasingly he feels the Qualitative aspects of investment will be a key driver of alpha, where anything Quantitative and that can be automated will be. Quality investing to Stephen is as much, if not more so, about the management of a business, and he aligns the portfolios to founders who maintain the owners\u2019 eye and have a superior problem solving ability over peers with no alignment of interest. A strong culture is vital; after all \u2018character is destiny\u2019. Stephen also likes an aphorism or two!\n\nWith a fast-growing reputation as an independent thinker, his musings are regularly featured in the press, including What Investment, Professional Advisor and MoneyWeek. Investment is one of the purest and most rewarding endeavours in Stephen\u2019s opinion and he is a firm believer in giving back to an industry he is so passionate about. With an irreverent style yet with deep thoughtfulness and humility.\n\nStephen is a CFA Charterholder, a devoted Warrington Rugby League fan and a wide-ranging reader.\n\nhttps://www.stellar-am.com/",

His biggest regret, moving to almost 100% cash in March, but he got back on the horse quickly, buying Polar Capital amongst others.  Hear more of his reflections and details of his 2021 pick.\n\nYear to date performance - 00:50\nWhat played out well in 2020: Polar Capital (POLR) - 05:15\nWhat was your biggest mistake, & the learning? - 11:20\n2021 outlook \u2013 12:45\nNovacyt (NCYT) - 13:50\n2020 pick: Bloomsbury (BMY) - 15:39\n\nAbout Richard in his words:\nMy interest in the London stock market came about in the early 80\u2019s \u2013 working over the summer holidays whilst at college, as a post boy \u2013 leading to being somewhat of a gofer for a man call Zimmerman, who help build Mercury Asset Management in the 1980s. The taste of the moving parts of the City gave me my first real joy of City life \u2013 and I loved it.\n\n1986 \u2013 joined Lazard Brothers (via the back door) as a Trust Accountant, valuing and doing the daily book-keeping for investment trusts/unit trusts. Had my chance to move to the front office in 1988 as an assistant fund manager on the bond the international desks. Met my first real mentor John Innes, helping to manage and win major international global accounts \u2013 flying around the world in my mid 20\u2019s.\n\nRealised the real way to learn the skills needed to manage money was via mentors \u2013 very good ones. My real passion is to manage money invested directly in stocks and shares \u2013 where I saw the excitement and thrills \u2013 and having the belief I could make serious money. Passed my analyst and other professional exams then had the chance to join a real modern day investment legend \u2013 Richard Smith \u2013 becoming his no.2 on the Lazard UK Small Companies desk. Over the following 5 years gained the opportunity to build the investment style foundation stones \u2013 I still follow today.\n\nThe importance of skilled mentors \u2013 is the real key to success of any young professional \u2013 especially in the investment world. True 30 years ago \u2013 true today.\n\n1997 \u2013 left Lazard to join the sell side (stockbroking), Chaterhouse- specialising in small and mid-cap UK companies. An amazing experience, helping to take a mid- ranking firm to No1.\n\n2001 \u2013 sold my soul to Merill Lynch.\n\n2005 \u2013 returned to the buy-side with Cazenove to help run the UK focused hedge funds \u2013 mixing my stock picking skills to their business cycle style. Ended up with about \u00a31.5billion of funds to manage and becoming one of the most successful performing UK hedge funds in the UK in that period, especially the GFC.\n\n2010 \u2013 left Cazenove to join Trium \u2013 a private family wealth office \u2013 manging our own money \u2013 no clients \u2013 simply an absolute returned focused approach. Long \u2013 short. And both short and long term objectives and managing my own pa. money alongside.",

Mainly punting penny shares and buying unit trusts all went quite well until the 1987 Black Monday Crash where he lost a third of his investments. Undeterred he returned to investing several years later and had good success in the tech boom, selling out early before most of the tech rout. Thereafter, he started investing and trading, mainly in small caps finding many multi-baggers and much greater success. He now runs a very restricted private chatroom of some 260 or so members where members discus the stock news of the day and stock merits and opinions, together with chat and banter re life, gardening, photography and more. He also has a cracking sense of humour and posts numerous great jokes and one-liners, (he wrote that bit).",

Paul talks about where he sees market opportunities.  How Amati dealt with CV19.  Companies he thinks are interesting.  What he's learned from mistakes.  Particularly thought provoking, his comment, it's not the losers that cost investors, but the expense of missing the great opportunities where you miss a multiple of what you invested.\n\nPaul\u2019s background \u2013 00:50\nPaul/Amati\u2019s performance - 03:15\nHow do you spot companies at such an early stage?- 06:30\nThose that didn\u2019t work out? - 14:30\nGB Group (GBG) - 16:33\nWhere we\u2019re at in the current Industrial Revolution? - 17:15\nExpertise required for bio tech? - 24:18\nPolarean Imaging (POLX) - 26:39\nHow did you respond to CV19? - 29:43\nDart Group/Jet2 (JET2) - 33:43\nRenalytix AI (RENX) - 36:29\nMaxcyte (MXCT) \u2013 42.54\n\nQ&A\n\nEqtec (EQT)  - 45:57\nThe hydrogen industry - 50 :47\nValue versus growth stocks - 54:28\n\nAbout Paul Jourdan:\n\nDr Paul Jourdan co-founded Amati Global Investors following the management buyout of Noble Fund Managers from Noble Group in January 2010, having joined Noble in 2007 as Head of Equities. His fund management career began in 1998 with Stewart Ivory, where he gained experience in UK, emerging market, and global equities. In 2000, Stewart Ivory was taken over by First State and Paul became manager of what is now TB Amati UK Smaller Companies Fund. In 2004, he was appointed Head of UK Equities at First State. In early 2005, he launched Amati VCT plc and he also manages Amati VCT 2 after the investment management contract moved to Amati Global Investors in 2010 (In 2018 Amati VCT merged into Amati VCT 2 which was then renamed Amati AIM VCT). Prior to 1998, Paul worked as a professional violinist, including a four-year period with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. He currently serves as a Director of Sistema Scotland and Clean Trade, both of which are UK registered charities.",

The taste of the moving parts of the City gave me my first real joy of City life \u2013 and I loved it.\n1986 \u2013 joined Lazard Brothers (via the back door) as a Trust Accountant, valuing and doing the daily book-keeping for investment trusts/unit trusts.  Had my chance to move to the front office in 1988 as an assistant fund manager on the bond the international desks.  Met my first real mentor John Innes, helping to manage and win major international global accounts \u2013 flying around the world in my mid 20\u2019s.  \n\nRealised the real way to learn the skills needed to manage money was via mentors \u2013 very good ones.  My real passion is to manage money invested directly in stocks and shares \u2013 where I saw the excitement and thrills \u2013 and having the belief I could make serious money.  Passed my analyst and other professional exams then had the chance to join a real modern day investment legend - Richard Smith \u2013 becoming his no.2 on the Lazard UK Small Companies desk.  Over the following 5 years gained the opportunity to build the investment style foundation stones \u2013 I still follow today.  The importance of skilled mentors \u2013 is the real key to success of any young professional \u2013 especially in the investment world.  True 30 years ago \u2013 true today.\n\n1997 \u2013 left Lazard to join the sell side (stockbroking), Chaterhouse- specialising in small and mid-cap UK companies.  An amazing experience, helping to take a mid- ranking firm to No1.\n\n2001 \u2013 sold my soul to Merill Lynch.\n\n2005 \u2013 returned to the buy-side with Cazenove to help run the UK focused hedge funds \u2013 mixing my stock picking skills to their business cycle style. Ended up with about \u00a31.5billion of funds to manage and becoming one of the most successful performing UK hedge funds in the UK in that period, especially the GFC.\n\n2010 \u2013 left Cazenove to join Trium \u2013 a private family wealth office \u2013 manging our own money \u2013 no clients \u2013 simply an absolute returned focused approach.  Long \u2013 short. And both short and long term objectives and managing my own pa. money alongside.",

He has an annual investment return of 30%+, and runs a private chatroom of over 250 members, who discuss stocks.  In this interview we glean more about how Richard invests to get such good returns, what he looks for; recovery plays he's holding, catalysts for selling, and a general feel for his investing style. \n\nIntroduction - 00:18\nRichard\u2019s background \u2013 00:53\nWhat return do you look to achieve? - 10:18\nWhat alerts you to a new investment? - 11:30\nToday, are you just looking for recovery plays? - 17:00\nXaar (XAR) - 18:47\nDe La Rue (DLAR) \u2013 24:18\nSIG (SHI) \u2013 29 :50\nHow long do you hold your core positions? - 35:33\nCatalysts for selling? - 36:46\nSize of holding size? - 37:28\nNumber of holdings? \u2013 39:07\nVertu Motors (VTU) - 40:00\n\nQ&A\nGreggs (GRG) & House builders - 42:48\nDid your style evolved through trial & errors?

Mainly punting penny shares and buying unit trusts all went quite well until the 1987 Black Monday Crash where he lost a third of his investments. Undeterred he returned to investing several years later and had good success in the tech boom, selling out early before most of the tech rout. Thereafter, he started investing and trading, mainly in small caps finding many multi-baggers and much greater success. He now runs a very restricted private chatroom of some 260 or so members where members discus the stock news of the day and stock merits and opinions, together with chat and banter re life, gardening, photography and more. He also has a cracking sense of humour and posts numerous great jokes and one-liners, (he wrote that bit).",

Bursting with enthusiasm, together with some great stock picks, with an engagingly honest insight to his reaction to CV19, which many will relate to.  Richard believes today is the beginning of an economic cycle, and is a great time for equity investors.  \n\nRichard\u2019s background - 00:46\nRichard\u2019s investing performance - 02:40\nInvesting style & stock selection - 03:24\nCovid-19 - 07:04\nWhat sectors to avoid \u2013 13:18\nThe business cycle philosophy - 15:50\nRichard\u2019s holdings and 2019 performance - 18:35\nRichard\u2019s been buying - 21:31\nWhat prompts Richard to sell - 23:40\nMacro thoughts \u2013 26:16\nRichard\u2019s watch list - 28:46\nPolar Capital (POLR) - 32:17  \nUP Global Sourcing (UPGS) - 37:46\nRedde Northgate (REDD) - 42:52\nQ&A \u2013 47:28\n\nOther companies mentioned: St James Place (STJ), Franchise Brands (FRAN); Telecom Plus (TEP); Legal & Genera (LEGN); M&G (MNG); Ted Baker (TED); Spectris (SXS).\n\nAbout Richard in his words:\n\nMy interest in the London stock market came about in the early 80\u2019s \u2013 working over the summer holidays whilst at college, as a post boy - leading to being somewhat of a gofer for a man call Zimmerman, who help build Mercury Asset Management in the 1980s.  The taste of the moving parts of the City gave me my first real joy of City life \u2013 and I loved it.\n \n1986 \u2013 joined Lazard Brothers (via the back door) as a Trust Accountant, valuing and doing the daily book-keeping for investment trusts/unit trusts.  Had my chance to move to the front office in 1988 as an assistant fund manager on the bond the international desks.  Met my first real mentor John Innes, helping to manage and win major international global accounts \u2013 flying around the world in my mid 20\u2019s.  \n\nRealised the real way to learn the skills needed to manage money was via mentors \u2013 very good ones.  My real passion is to manage money invested directly in stocks and shares \u2013 where I saw the excitement and thrills \u2013 and having the belief I could make serious money.  Passed my analyst and other professional exams then had the chance to join a real modern day investment legend - Richard Smith \u2013 becoming his no.2 on the Lazard UK Small Companies desk.  Over the following 5 years gained the opportunity to build the investment style foundation stones \u2013 I still follow today.\n \nThe importance of skilled mentors \u2013 is the real key to success of any young professional \u2013 especially in the investment world.  True 30 years ago \u2013 true today.\n \n1997 \u2013 left Lazard to join the sell side (stockbroking), Chaterhouse- specialising in small and mid-cap UK companies.  An amazing experience, helping to take a mid- ranking firm to No1.\n \n2001 \u2013 sold my soul to Merill Lynch.\n \n2005 \u2013 returned to the buy-side with Cazenove to help run the UK focused hedge funds \u2013 mixing my stock picking skills to their business cycle style. Ended up with about \u00a31.5billion of funds to manage and becoming one of the most successful performing UK hedge funds in the UK in that period, especially the GFC.\n \n2010 \u2013 left Cazenove to join Trium \u2013 a private family wealth office \u2013 manging our own money \u2013 no clients \u2013 simply an absolute returned focused approach.  Long \u2013 short. And both short and long term objectives and managing my own pa. money alongside.",

As well as being one of the two managing editors of Dynamic Investment Trends Alert, he is also currently Head of the Multi-Asset Research & Advisory team at the ECU Group. The team was awarded 'Independent Research House of the Year' and 'Best Independent Research House for Equities' in the Technical Analyst Awards 2018, 'Best Independent Research House for Fixed Income' and 'Best Independent Research House for Emerging Markets' categories of the 2017 Technical Analyst Awards and was also finalist in four categories of the 2016 Technical Analyst Awards.\n\nRobin began his career in the financial markets with Phillips & Drew in 1966, having taken a degree in economics at Nottingham University. He went on to become a partner at WI Carr, the first British stock broker to have offices in Hong Kong and Tokyo. Part of this firm was acquired by Grieveson Grant, with whom Robin enjoyed a stay in Japan. In 1986 Robin joined James Capel, which was already owned by HSBC. He stayed there until normal retirement age, and during that period travelled all over the world to meet their extended client base. For the last six years of that employment, Robin was resident in New York. Having left HSBC Investment Bank in 2004, Robin then joined Rathbones as head of asset allocation in 2005, where he stayed until 2007. During that period he advised Rathpeacon Management LLC \u2013 a hedge fund invested in the 500 largest Global companies.\n\nThereafter, he became the Technical Strategist for Cazenove Capital and managed the Worldwide Absolute Return hedge fund. Robin has been a regular on CNN, CNBC, Reuters and Bloomberg TV. He is a committee member and former chairman of the International Federation of Technical Analysts; former chairman, now fellow, of the British Society of Technical Analysts; and honorary member of the Swiss Association of Market Technicians (SAMT). Robin is also author of several notable financial market books, including Mapping the Markets, Future Storm, and has co-authored a chapter in the book Technical Analysis & Behavioural Finance in Fund Management: Discussions with Investment Managers and Analysts and Breakthroughs in Technical Analysis.",

His work has been rewarded with the accolade of winning three top-three sectoral, and one top-ten general, Thomson-Reuters StarMine stock-picking awards in 2008, 2009 and 2010.\n\nKeith experienced investment epiphany in the 1990s when he discovered the achievements of \u2018The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville\u2019. This group of successful investors drew their inspiration from the father of securities analysis, Benjamin Graham. They consistently outperformed the Standard & Poors 500 stock index year-in, year-out, despite having very different individual investment styles.\n\nThe common factor was their investment compass where Ben remained true north. Names such as Walter Schloss, Tom Knapp, Bill Ruane and Rick Guerin hardly register in most UK investors\u2019 minds but they are certainly \u2018superinvestors\u2019. \n\nTwo better known superinvestors are Warren Buffett and his investment partner, Charlie Munger. Keith has had the privilege of meeting these doyens of our industry on two separate occasions in Omaha, Nebraska. In addition to Graham, the influence of Philip Fisher can be found at work with Buffett and Munger. Learning from these masters transformed Keith\u2019s understanding of investment philosophy and with it, his investment performance. \n\nKeith was responsible for founding Sanford DeLand Asset Management Limited with the encouragement of a small group of businessmen who are now shareholders in the company.",

Here, Andrew covers more about risk management, meeting management, what he\u2019s learnt managing the fund, and much more.\n\nNote, this was recorded during February 2020, before COVID-19 gripped the nation, and torpedoed markets.  It would be interesting to get Andrew\u2019s perspective on where we are now!\n\nHow has MIFIDII affected you and the industry? \u2013 00:30\nHow do you gauge your margin of safety? - 02:26\nHow do you manage risk? - 04:17\nPosition sizes? - 06:12\nNumber of holdings? - 08:44\nCash position? - 09:57\nDo you think we\u2019re in a high-risk environment? - 12:10\nWhat\u2019s your view on meeting management? - 13:40\nDo you invest in IPOs? - 17:30\nAre there any companies you regret you didn\u2019t buy? - 18:44\nWhat\u2019s your worst mistake, and learnings? - 19:30\nWhat\u2019s the best thing you\u2019ve done for the fund? - 22:00\nCoronavirus and the macro picture - 24:14\nThe fund - 27:37\n\nCompanies mentioned: JD Weatherspoon (LON:JDW) 03:30; Sports direct (LON;SPD) 15:30; Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) 19:25\n\nSee Part one of Andrew's interview, here: https://www.piworld.co.uk/2020/03/20/the-investing-principles-of-andrew-hollingworth-part-one/\n\nAbout Andrew Hollingworth:\n\nAndrew started working in the investment industry when he was just 18 years old, having bought his first share when he was just 14. Andrew founded Holland Advisors around 15 years ago. At the time, Andrew realised that there was a proven way to be a more successful investor. The core driver behind the investment process at Holland is the use of investment approaches proved successful by the likes of Buffett and John Templeton. These clear processes helps them take a long-term approach in assessing companies, their managements and their prospects when trying to find the high-quality franchises that they think will compound at a good rate over time. Then, they will only buy shares in them if they are at an attractive price.\n\nAndrew says, \u201cWe think our USP is the disciplined application of proven value-investing approaches in an often efficient, but occasionally mispriced market. Our approach differs from many others in two important ways. First, we strongly believe you have to know what you are looking for in an investment before you go shopping. Our study of great investors has helped us refine our process. As a result we are very clear about the company business models we find attractive and why, and we only buy something when it comes with a margin of safety. The second point is our desire to learn. It is human nature to want to get better at something, but it is easy in this industry to be too busy to have the time to do so. There are always opportunities to learn and we welcome them.\u201d\n\nThe HollAnd Advisors website has a vast wealth of educational resources and is well worth checking out. Look for the pdfs, including: \u201cHow we invest and Think\u201d, and the latest article: \u201cThe Perfect Storm \u2013 Peak Fear \u2013 What to buy and when.\u201d \n\nTo find out more about Andrew and his fund: http://www.hollandadvisors.co.uk/",

The portfolio will be concentrated, generally comprising between 25 to 35 stocks. In our view investments must fall into the below criteria in order to qualify for selection within the portfolio: 1. The business must be fundamentally attractive, this means \u2022 it has the ability to grow and improve profitability over the long term \u2022 it must not face structural or imminent cyclical issues 2. The business must have an attractive price; \u2022 the business must have a current valuation that is attractive relative to its future growth and profitability \u2022 we expect the business to receive favourable revisions of medium-term consensus growth and profitability expectations These criteria enable the Investment Manager to select investments from a broad range of geographies and sectors with no particular sector or style bias.

The portfolio will be concentrated, generally comprising between 25 to 35 stocks. In our view investments must fall into the below criteria in order to qualify for selection within the portfolio: 1. The business must be fundamentally attractive, this means \u2022 it has the ability to grow and improve profitability over the long term \u2022 it must not face structural or imminent cyclical issues 2. The business must have an attractive price; \u2022 the business must have a current valuation that is attractive relative to its future growth and profitability \u2022 we expect the business to receive favourable revisions of medium-term consensus growth and profitability expectations These criteria enable the Investment Manager to select investments from a broad range of geographies and sectors with no particular sector or style bias. The Investment Manager will conduct detailed bottom-up fundamental research on each potential investment and in most cases produce their own financial model and forecasts of future performance.\r\n\nBlue Whale fact sheet: https://bluewhale.co.uk/factsheet/",

    "description": "Blue Whale was launched in September 2017, since when it\u2019s achieved an annualised return of 21%.  Here, Stephen gives us an insight to how he achieves those return, and what they do differently.  An interesting insight to those who manage their own money, or those who are interested specifically in Blue Whale Capital.\n\nIntroduction - 00:18\nHow do you know Peter Hargreaves - 00:34\nWhy did you launch Blue Whale in 2017? \u2013 01:00\nWhat does Blue Whale offer vs other funds? - 02:07\nWhat are you investing caveats? - 05:28\nModelling - 06:55\nTiming the market - 10:23\nHow much movement in the top 10 holdings? - 13:17\nAre there any holdings that didn\u2019t go so well? - 16:05\nHave you had any holdings you\u2019ve lost money on? - 19:07\nWhat time period do you use to judge performance? - 21:45\nHow long do you spend on research? - 23:54\nHow quickly can you respond to results? - 29:30\nWhy do you predominantly invest in the US? \u2013 32:12\nWhich other markets would you look at? - 36:55\nWhy large caps? \u2013 37:54\nWhat should we expect the average stock turnover pa? - 40:16\nHow much is the AMC? - 42:33\nWhat are your ambitions for Blue Whale? - 43:03\n\nBlue Whale investment objective: \n\nThe investment objective of the fund is to achieve capital growth over the long-term by investing in equities on a global basis, with a current focus on developed markets.  The portfolio will be concentrated, generally comprising between 25 to 35 stocks.  In our view investments must fall into the below criteria in order to qualify for selection within the portfolio:\n\n1. The business must be fundamentally attractive, this means\n\u2022 it has the ability to grow and improve profitability over the long term\n\u2022 it must not face structural or imminent cyclical issues\n\n2. The business must have an attractive price;\n\u2022 the business must have a current valuation that is attractive relative to its future growth and profitability\n\u2022 we expect the business to receive favourable revisions of medium-term consensus growth and profitability expectations\n\nThese criteria enable the Investment Manager to select investments from a broad range of geographies and sectors with no particular sector or style bias.  The Investment Manager will conduct detailed bottom-up fundamental research on each potential investment and in most cases produce their own financial model and forecasts of future performance. \n\nBlue Whale fact shee: https://bluewhale.co.uk/factsheet/",

    "description": "Keith Ashworth-Lord interview\nSanford DeLand, \nChief Investment Officer, The UK Buffettology Fund\n\nKeith was inspired by Benjamin Graham, which led him to Buffett.  Keith views his investments as a Business Manager, rather than a Fund Manager.  An approach which has rewarded him, with Return on Investment of c.200% since he launched the Buffettology Fund in 2014.  This outstanding performance has seen investors flocking to his fund, with FUM at \u00a31bn as at June 2019, up from \u00a30.5 billion in January 2019!\n\nIn this interview Keith outlines his investing caveats, which underpin his inspiring investment performance.  \n\nIntroduction \u2013 00:18\nKeith\u2019s career history and his path to Warren Buffett \u2013 01:08\nWhat\u2019s the optimum size of the fund? \u2013 08:35\nConstraints of the growth of FUM - 09:58\nHow much cash can you hold? - 12:44\nWhat are your investment criteria? - 15:19\nPorters five forces analysis \u2013 23:24\nHow much is the qualitative v quantitative? 24:00\nDoes the extra FUM reduce the investment choice? - 25:00 \nNew entrants to the portfolio \u2013 27:00\n\nKeith Ashworth-Lord biography: \n\nHe is a Chartered Fellow of the Chartered Institute for Securities & Investment, having formerly been an individual member of the Stock Exchange, and he holds the Investment Management Certificate of the United Kingdom Society of Investment Professionals.\n\nPrior to setting up the business and the UK Buffettology Fund, he was a self-employed Consultant working with a variety of stockbroking, fund management and private investor clients. His work has been rewarded with the accolade of winning three top-three sectoral, and one top-ten general, Thomson-Reuters StarMine stock-picking awards in 2008, 2009 and 2010.\n\nKeith experienced investment epiphany in the 1990s when he discovered the achievements of \u2018The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville\u2019. This group of successful investors drew their inspiration from the father of securities analysis, Benjamin Graham. They consistently outperformed the Standard & Poors 500 stock index year-in, year-out, despite having very different individual investment styles.\n\nThe common factor was their investment compass where Ben remained true north. Names such as Walter Schloss, Tom Knapp, Bill Ruane and Rick Guerin hardly register in most UK investors\u2019 minds but they are certainly \u2018superinvestors\u2019. \n\nTwo better known superinvestors are Warren Buffett and his investment partner, Charlie Munger. Keith has had the privilege of meeting these doyens of our industry on two separate occasions in Omaha, Nebraska. In addition to Graham, the influence of Philip Fisher can be found at work with Buffett and Munger. Learning from these masters transformed Keith\u2019s understanding of investment philosophy and with it, his investment performance. \n\nKeith was responsible for founding Sanford DeLand Asset Management Limited with the encouragement of a small group of businessmen who are now shareholders in the company.\n\n\nSigns of economic moat\nGrowth industries \u2013 market share\nManageable growth 5-6-7-8% steady eddie\nJames Halstead, Rawlings\nOperating margins increasing \u2013 otherwise competitive edge faltering\nProfit of capital: ROE average, and latest\n18%+ (some 20-60%) capital light\nFCF conversion 80% - rolling 5 yr period\nStrong balance sheet \u2013 net cash/single digit gearing\nManagement who can spend capital to create future extra earnings\nDon\u2019t like acquisitions \u2013 ego\nBargaining power of suppliers; customers; degree ind rivalry, threat of new entrants; threat of substitute products",

    "description": "Presentation by Tom Burnet, Executive Chairman \nLength: 35 mins \nAn overview of the company, covering the business model, where 95% of revenue comes from commission from transactions.  On signing up a client, there is a visible, repetitive revenue stream for the length of the contract.  Additionally, it is disruptive for a customer not to renew their contract. \nIP is key, and ACSO spend more on IP than their competitors, because they're bigger than their competitors.  This is back by their \"relentless commitment to service.\" \nTheir growth strategy is through acquisition and organic growth.  Tom discusses the last three acquisitions: Accesso (2012), Siriusware (2013), ShoWare (2014); and what these add to the ACsO offering.  ACSO will do more acquisitions, going forward. \nThe growth record over the last 7 years has been impressive, and Tom believes there's further growth to be achieved.  He has a personal target of $1bn turnover.  He outlines where growth might come from. \nIntroduction \u2013 00:20 \nCompany overview \u2013 3:00 \nHistory & growth Lo Q \u2013 6:32 \nHistory & growth Accesso acquisition \u2013 12:00 \nHistory & growth Siriusware acquisition \u2013 12:35 \nHistory & growth ShoWare acquisition \u2013 14:40 \nAccesso today \u2013 16:53 \nLocations \u2013 19:55 \nRevenue history & growth \u2013 20:59 \nLeadership team \u2013 21:42 \nSolutions overview (products) - 22:06 \nR&D - 26:52 \nPassport - 27:43 \nLoQueue \u2013 28:35 \nSiriusware - 30:20 \nShoWare - 30:56 \nWhat separates Accesso? - 31:32 \nStrong foundations for the future - 33:44 \nFinancial summary - 34:57",

    "description": "Here is piworld's second collaboration with Share Talk\u2019s Conkers\u2019 Corner.  Peter Higgins (@conkers3) interviews Edward Roskill, (@RoskillEdward) lawyer, corporate financier, ex JP Morgan Investment Banker, co-founder of Strata Partners and private investor.\n \nEdward began investing when he was around 16 years of age with put and call options - as Edward puts it \"with a very small amount, you could make your money do something amazing, or lose it completely!\"  For his 18th birthday, Edward received \u00a3500 worth of shares in two companies, this was his first introduction into investing in shares.\n \nEdward went to Cambridge where he attained an MA in Law. He qualified as a lawyer in 1994 with international law firm, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, practising corporate and commercial law, followed by merger and acquisition work. Edward then made the switch from the legal side to investment banking, corporate finance, with Robert Fleming and JP Morgan. As an investment banker, he was involved in a variety of transactions including public and private company acquisitions and disposals, private placements, IPOs and follow-on equity offerings.\n \nEdward gained a first hand view of how deals were put together from his time at Fleming and JP Morgan and then in 2002 he co-founded his own advisory firm Strata Partners \nhttp://www.strata-partners.com advising tech companies on mergers and acquisitions. Edward focuses, in particular, on IT services, business process outsourcing and software. He has acted for The Capita Group plc on its US$160m public offer for IBS OpenSystems plc (2008); for IBS AB on its US$100m sale and IPO of IBS OpenSystems plc; for Marlin Equity Partners on its US$32m million public offer for Chelford Group Plc; and for SunGard Data Systems on its US$242m successful public offer for Guardian iT plc (2002).\n \nFourteen years on, Edward remains a partner at Strata Partners and he spends about a third of his time working with specific clients and transactions. He spends two-thirds of his time managing his family's investments, where he focuses on small-cap and microcap AIM-listed investments. \n \nEdward's investment strategy is one of researching smaller companies that are less well examined and less looked at by fund managers, as that is where he finds \"little gems\" that are sensibly valued. Even then Edward is a firm advocate of visiting the company, meeting management and really getting to know the business before he makes any kind of investment. This enables him to reduce his risks and increase his conviction towards his investment. \n \nEdward stresses that one of his most important tenets of investing is, \"don't lose money\". The experienced and astute Edward states, \"even now I find I have much to learn\".\n\nHow he got started in trading [00:00:00]\n\nOn his educational and professional background [00:04:00]\n\n\"The stock price is always wrong... only right at one point in time, when a business is sold.\" [00:07:13]\n\nWhat is the ethos of Strata Partners? [00:09:53]\n\n\"Companies with less than \u00a350m market capitalisations tend to be less well examined by fund managers ... you can find little gems.\" [13:58:00]\n\n\"We all fall into the trap of looking at the price too closely ... often it's just unhelpful.\" [00:19:00]\n\n\"Just because you are investing in a large cap ... you may have a false sense of security\" [00:20:33]\n\nAn example: Hunting Group. [00:21:35]\n\nOn the importance of compounding and consistency. [00:24:55]\n\nHis sector preferences. [00:28:42]\n\nHe doesn't like these two sectors. [00:28:45]\n\nThe most significant lesson he tries never to forget [00:36:30]\n\nWhat does he look for in meeting with company management teams? [00:38:30]\n\nOn the importance of avoiding liars. [00:41:20]\n\nOn management greed. [00:41:48]",

Of course, 2016 was marked by Brexit, and investors negative sentiment to real estate, although PCA have noticed no impact.\nPalace Capital focus on commercial (mainly offices) and residential real estate outside London.  They seek opportunities with the possibility to add value, to generate higher rental income and higher asset value; many examples of sites and rational are given throughout the presentation.\nNeil Sinclair is obviously a highly experienced property man.  PCA are highly selective in purchases, with much due diligence, management personally  inspecting properties and speaking to locals to suss out the opportunity.  Obviously location is key, and proximity to rail stations is one criteria.  They often identify distress sales, which at face value might not appear distressed.  Sometimes they purchase the whole company purely to acquire the property assets, as a way around stamp duty.  They often benefit by timing negotiations seasonally.  It appears to culminate in shrewd acquisitions.\nSince this was filmed, PCA H1 results 21.11.16 have been released.",

    "description": "Here is piworld's first collaboration with Share Talk Conkers\u2019 Corner, below, Conkers\u2019 introduces David Stredder.\n\nWelcome to the 37th Share Talk Conkers\u2019 Corner, recorded on 17th November 2016, Peter Higgins (@conkers3) speaking to property entrepreneur, investor, Founder of Mello events and Director of ShareSoc, David Stredder (@carmensfella).\n\nDavid comes from a very humble background and was brought up in Lytham St. Annes in Lancashire. David states, \"my Mum and Dad were the best parents you could have,\" and it is clear that they provided him with the foundations for his entrepreneurial zeal and drive to achieve a good education and financial independence. His Mum would give him spelling and maths tests after school, and when he was 11, entered him into the scholarship test for the top school in Lancashire. David passed the test and went from being, \u201con free school milk at my smaller school, to \u201cone of the big boys at a part boarding school.\u201d\n\nDavid always worked during the school holidays and decided early on that he would not go to University. His mind was always on making money and although he went on to sixth form education, he opted for a computer operator job with a big Insurance company. He says however, that he was rubbish...\"it was just way beyond me\". David's next role was in London as an Information Officer. Part  sports  journalism, part taking dignitaries around Central London. This job provided David with lots of additional time on his hands and he decided to get into property and he invested some of his growing savings into two flats. He later found that his friends that had chosen to go to University needed to come to London for work and needed accommodation. Before long, he had built up the second largest property management company in South London.  \n\nIn the late 90s, this property business was sold to an industry consolidator and David decided to spread his money into investments that provided him with a return. Shortly after he formed a group for a monthly meet-up at a local restaurant called Mello. Thus, Mello events was born and grew and grew http://mello-events.co.uk/about-us/ \n\nSince then he has concentrated on his listed and unlisted investments and is an active small cap investor. David also became a Founder and Director of ShareSoc: http://www.sharesoc.org/directors.html fighting on behalf of private shareholders. ShareSoc do this by promoting shareholders' rights to companies and by seeking to influence Government and regulatory policy.\n\nDavid's investment strategy is one of finding small-cap companies that are lowly rated and are often family owned business. He position sizes all his investments and is a very patient investor. David's winning strategy eventually came to the attention of the author Guy Thomas and he was interviewed for his book \"Free Capital, How 12 Private Investors Made Millions in the Stock Market\". A book that I read some years ago and found thoroughly insightful.",

The dividend is increased by 5%.\nCAPEX investment and 3 acquisitions has cost \u00a310m, although debt is still only 9.9m (less that 1xEBITDA), due to NWF\u2019s strong cash generation.\n\nAchievement across each division:\n1. Feeds increased volumes and market share\n2. Foods at capacity, added repacked work\n3. Record fuel volumes\n\nMarket conditions have been difficult \u2013 dairy farmers have faced low milk prices; food distribution is competitive; the warm autumn and winter meant less demand for heating oil - however, in spite of this growth has been achieved.\n\nWhiting runs through each division, outlining the challenges and opportunities; and where the acquisitions fit in.\nBrexit: hasn\u2019t had much impact to date; and NWF don\u2019t anticipate any implications.\n\nUltimately, NWF has strong management, who spot growth opportunities, with the asset backing to take advantage of them.  Highly focussed on good cash generation and optimising share holder returns.\n\nNWF are trading in line with expectations for the first two months of new financial year; and the increase in dividend highlights the confidence in the future for the group.\n\nSlides can be downloaded here:\n\nhttp://www.piworld.co.uk/company-video-2016/2016/8/3/nwf-final-results-2016",

    "description": "Presentation by Mark Watkin Jones, CEO; Phillip Byrom, CFO; Alex Pease, Investment Director\n\nA brief overview of this comprehensive presentation:\n\nMark Watkin Jones, is the final family member in the company after many generations.  In 1990 Mark opened an office in Chester.  A contract to build 30 Premier Inn\u2019s for Whitbread launched him.   They then did contracts for Tescos and other supermarkets followed.\n\nThey started work on student accommodation in 1999, which has since become a core part of the business.\n\nIn 2008 WJG had \u00a3160m bank debt with HBOS, when Lloyds took over the debt, they wanted their money back.  This forced WJG to find another source of finance.  This is when they started working with the institutions to provide funding, providing them with exposure to property as an asset class and the yield it provides.\n\nToday WJG are most focussed on student accommodation (84% revenue and 94% profit), with more scope to grow in the Private Rental Sector.  Earnings are highly visible and they have low CAPEX requirement.\n\nAt every stage WJG keep risk and leverage to a minimum.  They have a carefully mapped out model, the stages are: site procurement and planning; transaction and funding; construction and delivery; scheme management.  They want 20% return on capital employed.  Most of the costs are known in advance, and they know the yield they can achieve post construction.  So site costs are negotiated based on that.  A site is bought subject to planning, again avoiding risk.  Occasionally if there\u2019s good visibility on planning, they\u2019ll buy without planning, which means they\u2019ll get a 20% increase on the return.\n \nWJG work with many different institutions including M&G, Legal and General.  They know who to go to for different opportunities.\n \nAlex Pease, Investment Director, talks through a little of the axioms of land purchase, and bringing the institutions on board.\n\nPhillip Byrom, CFO, runs through the H1 figures in detail.  Rev up 40.6% Adj PTP up 85%. GM has gone up to 16.1% from 14.7%, and this should increase to 17.9% in H2. \nWJG have a small residential section focussed on N Wales and the NW.  This has a land bank for future developments.\n\nThe IPO in March 2016 bought out the rest of the family.  Today, Mark is the only family member actively involved in the company.  Senior management have shares in the company.\n\nWith Brexit, it\u2019s too early to know if there\u2019s any impact.  To date, all is going ahead as normal.  Student accommodation is a good sector in uncertain times.  Institutional investors are in for the long term.  It\u2019s too early to judge if yields will change.  (Yields currently 4-7% dependent on location).\n\nSchemes for FY17 are all sold; they\u2019re currently working on FY18 and 19 to underpin future revenues.\n\nPresentation Slides can be downloaded at http://www.piworld.co.uk/company-video-2016/2016/7/18/watkin-jones-at-mello-13716",

    "description": "Leon opens, discussing ISAs, and his own success in becoming an ISA millionaire.  He covers the key axioms of his success:\n\n1. Compounded income \u2013 from capital growth and income reinvested over many years \n\n2. Tax free status of an ISA means none of the drag of tax costs on an ISA\n\n3. Avoid story stocks eg. Globo  Keep to quality stocks with a resilient future income stream.  He always starts with the numbers, before he listens to the story.  Avoid the sales pitch by management.  He looks for high margins and high returns on capital and equity.\n\n4. Cut losses and run profits.  60% of his investments were successful \u2013 he sold the losers.  Listen to company updates, and position accordingly.  If you take a 20% loss, you\u2019ve only got to make 25% to be back to be at breakeven. With a 90% loss, you need a 10 bagger to replace.  You\u2019re no worse off when you sell a loss-making share \u2013 but psychologically you\u2019re much better off.\n\n5. Liquidity is an issue in small caps, so you need to know the company and be assured about it\u2019s balance sheet to have confidence to hold through the inevitable volatility.\nHe goes on to talk about Brexit, (this was the Tuesday after it happened.)\n\nSummary of the Brexit effect:\n\u2022 \u00a3 = $1.30 from a peak of  $1.50\n\u2022 FTSE250 down 15%, now -9%\n\u2022 Gold: +$85 @ $1,350\n\u2022 Scrapped plans to end deficit by 2020\n\u2022 Total UK debt to continue to rise\n\u2022 Interest rates likely to go down\n\u2022 Cameron, Boris Johnson, Farage all left their jobs\n\u2022 Corbyn, fighting to hold his position\n\nImpact on the market:\n\u2022 A recession is highly likely \u2013 but not clear of its duration \u2026 2-5 years?\n\u2022 Deals are off: IPOs, property deals\n\u2022 Political risk is high: \no EU weakness / contagion\no US: Trump?\nLeon is trying to balance his portfolio for macro instability.  Increasing gold weighting through ETFs.  He is negative on corporate brokers, plant hire companies, premium property developers and UK retail.\nQ&A from the floor.\n\n\u2022 Did Leon sell before Brexit?\n\u2022 How do you run winners, when it\u2019s tempting to bank profit?\n\u2022 Which fund managers does Leon respect?",

At the top end of their stated achievable growth of 7-9%  per annum.\n\nPRV make specialist filters, supplying diversified markets: aviation, energy and industrial process, environmental, molten metals.  All are growth markets. With 25% profit contribution from each sector.  \n\nTheir filters are a small unit cost to service costly capital equipment.  Often the filters are required under legislation, and the supplier has to be accredited.  This creates strong barriers to entry, and guaranteed repeat business.\n\nPRV have low CAPEX, with high cash generation.  They use their cash for organic growth, (although opportunities are relatively limited), and they have a progressive dividend policy - currently 1.25% yield.\n\nAt the moment all markets look robust for 2016.   Staff costs are the main cost (not raw materials \u2013 commodities).  Their biggest threat would be destocking from a global recession \u2013 similar to what they experienced in 2009.

In the future, they want to increase discretionary fund management, directed to them through professional advisers.\n\nCurrently they work with 775 firms (of advisers), and would like to work with 2,500 of the total universe of 14,450.  They see great value in strategic alliances.\n\nThe market is growing, with an ageing population, less company pension provision (few final salary schemes) and the move away from annuities. They see tremendous scope for international growth too.  They target an average of 10% pa organic growth in funds under management.   \n\nDividends: they pay 2.15%, and have a progressive dividend policy.  Going forward, once investment in their back office is complete, they will become increasingly cash generative, so may review their current policy in line with shareholder appetites.  \n\nAs their trading update says, in spite of the challenging markets, investment performance and new business have remained strong.",

SFE think their new financing option with Barclays Capital is a core reason.  It does impact margins, but increased volume more than makes up for that.\n\nSteve Birmingham, CEO and Mike Robinson, CFO, talk through what\u2019s going on.",
