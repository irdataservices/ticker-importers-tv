    "description": "Rainbow Rare Earths interview with CEO George Bennett  \nThanks to Donald Trump and his critical minerals or \u2018Rare Earths\u2019 deal with Ukraine, Rare Earths are perhaps better known than they have ever been. Despite the deal, our interview with Rainbow Rare Earths CEO George Bennett, a Rare Earths expert, confirms that any Rare Earths in Ukraine are of no commercial value, and even if they had value, it would take 20 years to get those into production.\n\nRainbow Rare Earths (London: RBW) specialise in turning phosphate gypsum feedstock from old mine waste into high-demand rare earths using a sophisticated patented chemical processing flowsheet. And Rainbow will  soon \u2018probably be the lowest cost producer in the Western world\u2019 \u2013 possibly even cheaper than China.\n\nGeorge Bennett and his team are patiently perfecting the technique in a South African pilot plant, working towards creating 99.5% pure Rare Earths for sale to Western countries. A Definitive Feasibility Study is due by the end of the year. \n\nThe supply of Rare Earths and pricing is currently controlled by the Chinese, who have \u2018weaponised\u2019 the supply chain according to George Bennett, which is why the DFC (Development Finance Corporation)  in Washington agreed $50M of financing 18 months ago for Phalaborwa, the main project in South Africa.\n\nRare Earths demand in the West is inevitably set to rise with the geopolitical friction between China and America. Various Rare Earths are used in everything from phones and consumer electronics to defence weaponry, and in particular for magnets in renewables wind turbines.",

This is where we collect your questions and get Shaun to answer them. \n\nAs most of you know, Shaun had his travel problems getting to the UK. He  powered through and presented at our hastily rearranged in-person Town Hall after 36 hours of travel and a medical emergency stopover in the Maldives.\n\nThe high-achieving Mid-Cap Australian gold/copper producer emerging from the Havieron/Telfer purchase is clearly a very different beast. With physical gold priced at an all time high, the first Quarterly Results released in March set a  high bar. \n\nDespite losing a day, Shaun still made time for an online Town Hall Q&A. Donald Leggatt from Ticker TV/Copia Digital caught up with the Greatland Gold MD and put some of your many excellent questions to him here.\n\n#gold #ggp #greatlandgold #copper  #asx  #aim #tungsten",

Echo Energy was recently renamed Nativo, and senior management have refocused the business on artisanal mining in Peru, moving on from legacy energy assets in Argentina. \n\nIn an in-depth interview with Ticker TV, Nativo Resources Non-Executive Chairman Christian Yates and CEO Stephen Birrell discussed the new Peru-focused artisanal gold and silver strategy for the company, which they have been developing since taking control in November 2023.  \n\nThis is divided into two strands: Nativo has bought a 50% stake in the Tesoro Gold Concession in Northern Peru for $750,000, and the strategy there is to kick-start this artisanal gold mine quickly, to develop production and to reinvest revenues. The company believes this is where the quick wins are, and options to buy land and create a processing plant to process ore from Tesoro (60 tonnes per day) and from other artisanal producers has recently been signed.\n\nThe second, medium-term focus for the business is to develop a separate revenue stream clearing up legacy polymetallic tailings dumps in Southern Peru, extracting gold and silver from these and sorting out any hazards as part of the clean-up process. Three sites in close proximity to one another have been identified, with tailings of around 5 million tonnes in total.  \nChristian Yates and Stephen Birrell were interviewed by Donald Leggatt, Head of IR Media at Ticker TV.\n\n0:00 Introduction\n0:57 Change of name and sector\n5:17 What do you get out of the Tesoro deal\n6:10 Tesoro, a long history of gold production and data\n8:49 High grade assays and 5 main gold veins announcement\n11:36 Mining plan; how will Tesoro be mined\n13:48 Agreeing offtake terms with third party producers\n15:33 Next steps for the Bako 50:50 JV\n16:28 Funding and development of the new processing plant\n24:57 Capex and funding requirements\n26:58 The vision for Nativo Resources; two years time",
