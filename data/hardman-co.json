    "description": "In this edition of Hardman Talks, Keith Hiscock speaks with highly experienced analyst Jason Streets about his latest note on the asset management sector entitled 'Radical derating presumes things only get worse'. Jason explores why UK-listed asset managers have fallen sharply\u2014down 45% on average since February 2023\u2014despite rising markets and stable margins. He discusses the impact of the shift to passive and private assets, the lack of scale benefits in active management, and why some companies might now be trading at low levels. The conversation also covers wealth managers and platforms, highlighting potential opportunities and risks across the broader investment landscape.\n\nFind out more on our website: https://hardmanandco.com/hardman-talks-derated-but-not-defeated-resilience-uk-asset-management/\n\nImportant notice:\n\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

    "description": "In this edition of Hardman Talks, CEO Keith Hiscock is joined by Dr Martin Hall, Head of Life Sciences, to discuss the sharp decline in UK healthcare stocks and what this means for investors. With the Hardman & Co Healthcare Index down 17.7% in 2024\u2014its third consecutive annual fall\u2014Martin outlines the challenges facing small and mid-cap companies, from dwindling institutional support to aggressive equity raises that dilute retail shareholders. Having improved balance sheets during 2024, Martin believes that the focus in 2025 will be the achievement of sales traction for regulatory-approved products (see page 14 of the Hardman & Co Healthcare Index: https://hardmanandco.com/research/corporate-research/hardman-co-healthcare-index-6/).\n\nMartin explores the deeper structural issues affecting the sector, including company delistings, suspensions, and the continuing capital shortfall in 2025. Yet, despite the downturn, Martin still sees hope in the strength of UK healthcare innovation\u2014if it can secure the funding it needs to survive.\n\nFind out more on our website: https://hardmanandco.com/hardman-talks-uk-healthcare-stocks-under-strain/\n\nImportant notice:\n\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

He predicts that the UK will likely suffer a recession in 2025. Business confidence has cratered since the budget and the employment market is suffering. We will likely see higher inflation and interest rates than would otherwise have been the case. \n\nFrom a political point of view, investors should mark 26 March 2025 in their diary, when the OBR delivers its spring report. If this goes the wrong way, we might see further tax rises and spending cuts after. Already markets are questioning how long Reeves has left in the job. Labour MPs are also worrying about re-election after just six months. If Reeves goes, the Prime Minister would not be far behind.\n\nThe first interview can be found here: https://youtu.be/RhGYNxmdQEE\n\nImportant notice:\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

He had expected investors to bear the brunt of the measures raising tax revenues to fill the alleged \u00a322bn \u2018black hole\u2019. However, it transpired that employers were coshed through changes in National Insurance.\n\nKeith explains how the Chancellor seems to have committed a number of unforced errors. The evidence is that, far from boosting GDP growth, the budget has killed business confidence. Normally it is external events that provide the difficulties for Chancellors \u2013 but not this one.\n\nThis is the first of two interviews about the article.

Despite the explosion of coverage and interest in the technology sector at the moment, the Polar Capital Technology Trust is one of just three investment companies specialising in the space, and by far the largest by market cap.\n\nAlastair discusses the universe of stocks in which the trust can invest, the process of choosing individual holdings and the themes informing their choices. Not only does the trust provide investors with an exposure to a spread of technology companies globally, but the trust\u2019s shares trade at a discount of nearly 13% to the net asset value of the underlying holdings.\n\nFind out more on our website: https://hardmanandco.com/hardman-talks-polar-capital-technology-trust-broad-technology-exposure-discount/\n\nImportant notice:\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

    "description": "In this Hardman Talks, Larissa Adams interviews Richard Angus, Head of Business Development at Hardman & Co, on the critical concept of 'ROOM risk' (or the risk of 'Running Out Of Money') and its growing relevance in private company valuations. \n\nROOM risk evaluates a company's ability to sustain itself financially before reaching profitability or securing new funding, especially in today's volatile economic climate. Richard emphasises that ignoring the risks of financial exhaustion can result in the destruction of previously created value, urging companies and investors to assess financial sustainability proactively.\n \nRichard notes that current economic challenges, such as post-COVID recovery and higher inflation, have heightened the relevance of ROOM risk, with many UK businesses failing due to liquidity pressures and limited access to funding. He stresses that investors are advised to factor in ROOM risk to ensure that they are assessing businesses based on fair value rather than over-optimistic growth projections. \n\nWatch the discussion now to find out more.\n\nImportant notice:\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

    "description": "In this Hardman Talks, Keith Hiscock sits down with Dr Martin Hall, Head of Life Sciences at Hardman & Co. \n\n2023 was a difficult year for small life sciences companies (pharmaceutical, biotech, medtech, diagnostics, healthcare), largely because it was apparent that several companies were in need of additional working capital, causing share prices to be marked down in anticipation of equity raises. 2024 has started much the same. At the time of writing, 21 companies have announced capital increases, raising \u00a3174m, and there are at least 10 other companies known to be in need of cash over the coming months.\n\nIt is well known that this is a capital intensive industry, so what has changed? When Martin started as an analyst 36 years ago, there were many more institutional investors and nearly all had either a specialist healthcare team or a specialist small cap team. Extensive consolidation within the investment community, increased regulation and risk assessment within pension funds, and a vast increase in wealth being invested has resulted in a small number of groups with enormous funds under management. Consequently, their interest in small cap companies has evaporated, preferring to use alternative investment funds for their exposure to this space. Only a handful of institutional investors still have specialist healthcare analysts, so when a small cap healthcare company needs a capital increase, its options with the institutional investors are very limited.\n\nAs a result, companies have sought alternative sources of funding, which has often resulted in a disaster for existing shareholders. Companies have undergone a trade sale at a minimal valuation, delisted and returned to private hands, moved their listings to US, or, sadly, gone bust. Small life science companies desperately need more support. Unless there is a significant change within UK institutional investors, the life sciences sector will disappear. \n\nWatch the interview now to find out more about the sector, and read the report for free on our website: https://hardmanandco.com/research/corporate-research/hardman-co-healthcare-index-5/\n\nImportant notice:\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

    "description": "In this Hardman Talks, Paul Mylchreest talks to Larissa Adams about his views on silver and his recent Insight piece, 'Is silver the cheapest asset on the planet?'.\n\nSilver rarely makes it on to the radar of many professional and retail investors. However, it has a wide range of applications as a precious metal, monetary metal and critical industrial metal with uses in electronics and green energy, e.g. smart phones, electric and solar panels. \n\nThe Silver Institute estimates that the silver market has been in deficit for the past five years for 2019-23. We think that its estimates substantially underestimate silver used in demand for solar panels in 2023, which likely almost doubled. Global solar installations increased by 64% in 2023 to 423GW while silver loadings in solar panels increased due to the rapid shift from PERC-type to more efficient N-Type solar panels. \n\nGoing forward, we expect mine supply to remain fairly stable with simultaneous growth in both investment and industrial demand. Not only will this lead to bigger deficits, but investment demand could crowd out industrial demand, with a knock-on effect on the silver price.\n\nWatch the interview now to find out more.\n\nRead Paul's Insight on our website: hardmanandco.com/research/corporate-research/is-silver-the-cheapest-asset-on-the-planet/\n\nImportant notice:\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

    "description": "In this Hardman Talks, Stephen Samuel talks to Keith Hiscock about his recent note on investment company liquidity, 'Steady as she goes, but could be better'. In the note, Keith analyses liquidity for ICs as a whole and compares traditional with alternative ICs, as well as interrogating the data by market capitalisation and by sector. \n\nStephen and Keith discuss how to define liquidity, and they explore the consequences of lower liquidity for companies and investors. Finally, Keith suggests ways that investment company liquidity can be boosted to make shares more attractive to investors. \n\nLiquidity is the lifeblood of markets and measuring it over time is a way of gauging a market\u2019s health. Investment company liquidity is under strain, especially for the smallest funds, and sponsored research may be a way to improve this.\n\nWatch the interview now to find out more about investment company liquidity and read the report for free on our website: https://hardmanandco.com/research/corporate-research/investment-company-liquidity-steady-as-she-goes-but-could-be-better/\n\n\nImportant notice:\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

Such is the turmoil that the first step for investors is to try to see whether any financial numbers and ratios quoted are on a firm footing or not. This is what Mike does in this second analysis of REIT share price prospects.\n\nWe look at NAVs by sector in the light of the past seven years and in particular the past two. We find NAVs still falling but with a very important series of clues to more solid prospects. We see changes in trends for rents and values on retail assets and as ever alternative assets are doing far better. \n\nYou can read Mike's research on our website: www.hardmanandco.com\n\nWatch the discussion now to find out more.\n\nImportant notice:\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

    "description": "In this episode of Hardman Talks, Keith Hiscock and Riccardo Bindi are joined by Annabel Brodie-Smith, Communications Director of the Association of Investment Companies, to talk about discounts to net asset value in the sector.\n\nIn November, the AIC announced that the discount in the investment company sector was the widest since 2008, when the world was in the depths of a severe financial crisis. The discount has been widening steadily since 2022, owing to a combination of rising inflation, rising interest rates, and a general rise in geopolitical risk following the invasion of the Ukraine.\n\nThe discount or premium of the share price to the value of the underlying assets (NAV) is a distinguishing feature of investment companies compared to open-ended funds, often known as unit trusts. Annabel explains how a discount or premium comes about, and what it means.\u00a0Widening discounts to NAVs in times of increased risk-aversion are nothing new, of course, but we thought this was something worth discussing as this has historically been a good time for long-term investors to pick up some bargains. Returns after the 2008 crisis, when discounts were last at these levels, are ample testament to why these might be interesting times for investors to be looking at investment companies.\n\nThe industry body for investment companies, the AIC has a remit to improve understanding of ICs for all investors. \n\nRead the note on the AIC website here: https://www.theaic.co.uk/aic/news/press-releases/investment-company-discounts-widest-since-2008\n\nWatch the discussion now to find out more.\n\nImportant notice:\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

Following the events at the Woodford Equity Income Fund (WEIF) in 2019, professional investors increasingly focus on liquidity when making investment decisions. However, our research shows that the total value of trading companies (excluding investment companies and financials) had declined from 60.6% of their average market capitalisation in 2016 to 44.3% in 2022. There has also been a reduction in institutional interest in the UK equity market, e.g. pension funds.\n\nCan anything be done about the fallen liquidity? We outline some suggestions to help company management teams to improve liquidity in their shares.\n\nWatch the interview to find out more.\n\nRead the full report here: https://tinyurl.com/liquidityreview\n\nImportant notice:\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

    "description": "Following the recent announcement of a placing and public offer by Surface Transforms, the management team of David Bundred, chairman, Kevin Johnson, CEO, and Isabelle Maddock, CFO, appeared on Hardman Talks to explain the need for further funding. This will support the expansion in manufacturing capacity, itself driven by strong customer demand.\n\nIn this update to investors SCE provides detail on the roll-out of its recent production starts on five models and the steps taken on increasing output. SCE currently has financial resources \u2013 a debt line is in the last stages of approval \u2013 to fund expansion to \u00a3150m annual sales capacity by 2027 with the benefit of modelled cash generation to 2027, and then beyond.\n\nThe most pressing issue for investors is the delay in achieving the fourfold production rise for which the production line has been expanded. Output in October ran at \u00a31m, which is a rise of two-and-a-half times compared with the average rate last year. De-bottlenecking is the key, as there are seven 'single points of failure ' in the ca. 30-step production process. SCE has already paid for and is installing production equipment to raise capacity further, to \u00a350m p.a. sales. The de-bottlenecking of processes on the existing enlarged line has driven turnover expectations and estimates for 2024E and the progressive roll-out of the \u00a350m capacity impacts in stages through the year, leaving SCE with scope for elimination of the bottlenecks in this next year.\n\nWith only one competitor in a large and rapidly growing auto component market with at least three major environmental advantages \u2013 weight, particulates and end-of-life \u2013 the delivery on the \u00a3390m order book is the constraint to sales. Demand most certainly is not. The order book is to 12 models, stretching ca. seven years, with five currently live. SCE updated on its strong relationship with its customers, which remains cooperative and good. The next update is anticipated in January 2024.\n\nRead more about the event here: https://hardmanandco.com/hardman-talks-surface-transforms-open-offer-qa/\n\nImportant notice:\n\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

    "description": "In this Hardman Talks, Riccardo Bindi and Keith Hiscock discuss their note on \u201cEquity Income \u2013 UK or Global?\" which you can read here: tinyurl.com/ukorglobal\n\nThe UK Equity Income sector (UKEI) is the fourth largest investment company sector, with \u00a310.5bn of assets, and the traditional home for investors looking for income in the equity market. The UKEI not only provides investors with a better dividend yield than the general UK market, but also has a strong track record of dividend growth. Indeed, many funds feature on the Association of Investment Companies' \u201cDividend heroes\u201d list for the number of years of consistent growth. The UKEI is also marked by the longevity in the role of many of the fund managers, and has some of the longest established funds. \n\nThe note asks whether there is justification for investors seeking income to consider three other sectors, Global, Global Equity Income and Asia Pacific Equity Income. Some investors might want to consider investing part of their portfolios in non-UK funds to diversify their risk, others might think of them as replacements for the UK. The global income funds benefit from the ability to fish in a wider pool of possible holdings than the UKEIs. They also give the investor currency exposure. Another reason to consider the global funds is their superior share price performance over ten years. Finally, though the starting yield is lower than the UKEI sector, these global funds have, historically, seen faster dividend growth.\n\nThe two questions we seek to answer are: why would you still want an income fund, and if you do want to invest in one, should you consider a global fund as well as a UK one?   \n\nWatch the interview now to hear more.\n\nImportant notice:\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

    "description": "Association of Investment Companies CEO, Richard Stone, joins us on the latest episode of Hardman Talks for a chat with Keith Hiscock about the AIC, investment companies and retail investors.\n\nRichard talks about how investment companies (IC) differ from open-ended funds, such as unit trusts. He also points out some of the unique asset classes that the IC structure has been used to give investors access to. The fact that ICs are set up as companies means that they do not necessarily trade at the net asset value, or NAV, thus there are occasions when the assets can be purchased at a discount to NAV.\n\nICs provide all investors with the opportunity to participate in a wide variety of assets with professional management. Finally, Richard explains the resources that the AIC makes available to investors through its website.\n\nWatch the interview to hear more.\n\nImportant notice:\n\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

The company has just announced the completion of a placing and subscription to raise \u00a316m and is now making an Open Offer to qualifying shareholders for another \u00a33m of new shares.\n\nManagement talks about how the proceeds of these fundraisings are necessary to build capacity to meet the accelerating demand from the world\u2019s leading car manufacturers for the company\u2019s product. The company has made substantial progress with OEMs on new orders. It already has sufficient orders to fully utilise the extra capacity provided by phase 2 of the expansion of the current Knowlsey factory, but no spare capacity to meet additional orders. The proceeds of the fundraising will be used to boost the potential output of the current factory by 50%, provide the working capital that further orders will entail and start work on the second factory.\n\nThe company is one of only two carbon ceramic brake manufacturers in the world. The shares offer an opportunity to participate in a UK growth story in the manufacturing sector with good green credentials to boot.\n\nImportant notice:\n\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

Since Larissa\u2019s last sit-down with Derek, Netflix has released a disappointing update in the first quarter of this year \u2013 reporting a potential loss of 200,000 subscribers. This marked the first time the streaming giant has lost subscribers in over 10 years. So, we decided to welcome Derek back onto Hardman Talks to find out what these new updates mean for the sector, and if there are any changes to his views.\n\nDuring the interview Derek answers questions on the future of the subscriber revenue model, content spend, advertising markets and investor sentiment, while also answering the bigger question at play: has the streaming bubble burst?\n\nImportant notice:\n\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

In this webinar, we heard from Volta\u2019s manager how it is \u201cSeizing opportunities in volatile times\u201d. It reduced the cost of embedded leverage significantly in 2021 through refis and rests and the majority of the Company\u2019s assets are floating rate (so benefiting from rising interest rates). Additionally, the flight to safety and the US dollar strength has benefited shareholders with around 30% net exposure. As at the end of April Volta's YTD performance was positive. With cashflows of 15%-17% of NAV, the dividend (8% of NAV) is very well covered and excess cash flow gives the flexibility to add attractive primary and secondary opportunities with high projected returns. Looking forward defaults are expected to rise (maybe in the area of 1% at the end of 2022 (lower for the US) and 2% to 3% default rate in 2023) but Volta may be expected to benefit from higher WAS (Weighted Average Spread) inside CLOs, generating strong cash flows from Volta\u2019s CLO equity positions. The starting position for corporates is very positive with profits up 31% 4Q\u201921 on 4Q\u201919 while corporate debt is up 15% over the same period.\n\nThe Q&A session was very broad, covering a number of aspects of credit risk, management and control, discount management, the dividend and prospective growth, fees, operational issues and management and AXA IM\u2019s competitive advantages.\n\nRead more and download the presentation slides here:\nhttps://hardmanandco.com/hardman-talks-volta-finance-webinar-seizing-opportunities-volatile-times/\n\nImportant notice:\n\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

We explored how PE-backed companies are investing in tech-enabled businesses and companies benefitting from digitalisation disruption across multiple sectors, with many niche sub-sectors underrepresented or zero-represented on public markets. We reviewed the valued added by the expertise PE provides and how it works in practice, its impact on society and the investment opportunities these trends are creating.\n\nThe wide-ranging Q&A session covered these areas and realisations, ESG in PE, PIN\u2019s asset selection, NAV and discount philosophies and long-term outperformance.\n\nRead more and download the presentation slides here:\nhttps://hardmanandco.com/hardman-talks-pantheon-international-webinar-private-equity-funding-future/\n\nImportant notice:\n\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

This webinar enabled those who were unable to attend the day in Knowsley to watch the presentation that was made and ask questions of the management. The webinar was hosted by David Bundred, Chairman, who introduced Kevin Johnson, CEO, and Michael Cunningham, CFO.\n\nSurface Transforms is one of two manufacturers in the world of carbon-ceramic discs for the brakes for cars. These discs offer far superior braking performance to traditional iron discs, but also have a number of other positive attributes; these include substantially longer life, dramatic weight-saving (especially beneficial because the saving is of the unsprung weight of a car), and virtually no dust generation/pollution.\n\nCarbon-ceramic discs are seeing a rapid uptake by car manufacturers, initially at the upper end of their ranges. Surface Transforms has already secured a number of large OEM contracts and is now working on increasing capacity.\n\nDuring the call, management was questioned on a number of areas, such as the execution risk in upscaling capacity, inflation in raw materials and wages and supply chain disruption impacting the business.\n\nImportant notice:\n\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

James shares his views on the investor\u2019s role in driving change, being a firm advocate of engagement with companies rather than divestment. The discussion touches on the increased role of regulation in ESG and concludes with James outlining how investors can navigate the market in choosing funds that are genuinely sustainable from the huge array of funds labelled ESG.\n\nUKSIF represents a diverse range of financial services firms committed to these aims, and its 270+ members manage over \u00a310tn in assets, including investment managers, pension funds, banks, financial advisers, research providers and NGOs, among others. UKSIF and its members have been hugely active in, and supportive of, efforts to promote the sustainable finance agenda and the organisation has worked closely with policymakers and others to find new ways to overcome the barriers to the growth of sustainability and deliver progress towards decarbonisation of the economy.\n\nJames Alexander has a background in international climate finance and infrastructure finance.

    "description": "FAV\u2019s manager, Nitin Bajaj, joined Hardman & Co for a wide-ranging Q&A session. It gave investors a detailed insight into his investing approach as well as the current portfolio. The trust\u2019s key characteristics are buying good businesses (defined as having products that customers want to buy, earning high ROE, with honest and competent people), bought at good prices (defined as offering a margin of safety), and these themes ran through the session. These traits mean that ESG is embedded as a good business practice, not a marketing slogan, and regulatory risk should be below average.\n\nOne of the highlights was exploring Nitin\u2019s views on why the trust has beaten the benchmark by, on average, 5% p.a. over five years. He identified two key drivers for this: i) repeating the strict investment process and discipline, thereby ensuring the avoidance of drastic errors; and ii) the depth and quality of the investment people.\n\nAnother area investors have looked at is China where the trust has 32% in China and HK investments but it really not should be seen as a proxy for that market. It does not have large-cap exposure. As Nitin explores in this interview, and we have detailed in our notes, by investing in companies that help promote \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d and are good employers, regulatory risk should be well below average.\n\nOther topics included how stocks are selected, case studies of the largest positions, a philosophy of buying businesses not stocks, gearing, ESG, attitudes to sectors (or rather why sectors are not important), and when the investment approach is and when it is not in favour.\n\nImportant notice:\n\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

They discuss investing in early-stage drug discovery and how the environment has changed dramatically over the past couple of decades, with many major drug companies de-emphasising early-stage research. They effectively rely on smaller companies' finding and starting to develop interesting compounds, with the aim of buying them and only putting their resources behind them once there is some evidence of progress.\n\nWe talk about the attractions of drug platforms over those will a single compound. We dig into how AI is changing this landscape: Sunil is very keen on how it is helping those at the early stage of drug discovery to find more and better candidates for investigating. We also discuss areas that look particularly promising at the moment and what makes them interesting just now. Finally, Sunil explains the advantages of Knowledge Intensive Approved Funds for investors and why o2h became the first in the market to use this new structure.\n\nImportant notice:\n\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

    "description": "The ever-topical debate of 'Streamers vs. Broadcasters' has debuted on Hardman Talks in our latest interview between Larissa Adams and media analyst, Derek Terrington. The interview begins with Derek breaking down his thoughts on the latest results' trends from major streamers and the impact on broadcasters. The discussion then moves on to tackle key themes within the relationship between advertisers and broadcasters, oversaturation within the streaming industry, content creation, and the growth prospects for both streamers and broadcasters.\n\nStreaming is the most disruptive force in video media. Globally, streamed video services continue to grow, led by the US majors, apparently at the expense of nonstreamed and advertising- dependent broadcasters. Recent trading announcements by leading streamers and leading UK broadcasters point in two directions: streaming growth in the North American market is slowing, according to figures from Netflix and Disney, while UK public service broadcasters (PSBs) reported a strong advertising recovery in 3Q21. Both trends were influenced by the pandemic, which slowed the production of new content \u2013 this is unwinding and points to a healthy 4Q21. Similarly, leading UK PSBs expect a strong 4Q, with advertising at record levels.\n\nDownload the full report here:\nhttps://www.hardmanandco.com/research/corporate-research/streamers-vs-broadcasters/\n\nImportant notice:\n\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

Chesnara grows its book in two ways - the consolidation of closed books of life policies and writes new business in term assurance and pensions. The company operates in three geographies, the UK, Sweden and the Netherlands and management cover the trends prevailing in each territory. \n\nChesnara is unique in the financial services space, having paid an increasing dividend over the 17 years of its existence. David sets out the financial return metrics and highlights that the outlook for Chesnara is an improvement in new business trends and acquisitions are most likely in areas in which the company already operates. New CEO Steve discusses the recent acquisitions and how Chesnara has a supportive shareholder base and the balance sheet flexibility to take advantage of deals coming to the market. These should add to Chesnara\u2019s cash generation and, ultimately, support a growing dividend. This is a high yielding investment with a strong degree of predictability and good growth prospects.\n\nImportant notice:\n\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

Jason then goes on to explain the way in which he overcame the challenges of growing a business, going from one van to several, stepping into overseas markets, and overcoming that urge of founders to make every decision and not let go. Finally, we learn of his journey to become a public company, and the advice he would give to other managements who are considering listing.\n\nFilta Group plc is a market-leading commercial kitchen services business, quoted on the AIM market. It services restaurants, supermarkets, stadiums, healthcare, education, hotels and amusement parks. The company is trusted by many global brands, specialising in fryer management and grease & drain management, servicing equipment that requires regular maintenance. The group\u2019s core business operations are within North America, the UK and mainland Europe. The North America and mainland Europe operations are exclusively operated as a franchise network, while the UK activities are operated under both franchise and direct sale business models.\n\nImportant notice:\n\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

    "description": "Why are the fees so high? How can they use so much debt? Is PE in a bubble? And why do so many listed funds trade at a discount? In this edition of Hardman Talks, we invited Steven Tredget, a partner at Oakley Capital, for a no-holds barred Q&A on private equity. The asset class is more important than ever, as institutional investors pour money into PE and more private companies partner with private equity firms. But the industry still needs to shake off the many negative perceptions that hurt its reputation. Mark Thomas, Hardman & Co Head of Investment Companies research, put the audience's tough questions to Steven. Oakley Capital Investments has generated market-beating returns from its concentrated, three-sector focused portfolio of private equity investments via Oakley Capital (Oakley) PE funds. Oakley has a proven model for sourcing investments, creating sustainable value and consistently delivering superior returns.\n\nImportant notice:\n\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

Sharing a compelling account of fond memories on how he started the business, Michael takes us through his journey of developing WET Group into the water company it is today.\n\nThe multi-divisional WET Group has centred its B2B product offering around its unique IP, namely the Natralysis process. Known as the \u201cWater Designers\u201d, WET Group's technology creates top quality alkaline water that can be commercialised in many industries including agriculture, and the soft drinks markets. Throughout the interview we learn about the many opportunities and commercial partners WET Group now has access to as it begins to monetise its IP further. Michael also touches on WET Group's current fund raising and future growth plans to scale up the business.\n\nImportant notice:\n\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

Jason contemplated how the roadmap for the return to normal trading after the pandemic looked by territory and business line. We also reflected on new gains (first franchise in France, 8 new franchise sales, 13 new Mobile Filtration Units and the new Cyclone Grease Recovery Unit), suggesting that the period of battening down the hatches is over.\n\nThe results were encouraging (cash inflow from operations doubled, debt halved and EBITDA bounced back). Jason explained how they did it, and what it tells us about the characteristics of the business. We also covered likely headwinds, such as staff pressures. Finally, we reminded ourselves of the market opportunity by territory. There is no company like Filta quoted in London \u2013 growing niche markets in services to catering, with a large US presence, and a franchise model to boot.\n\nImportant notice:\n\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

    "description": "Following Surface Transforms' interim results, we invite you to watch a presentation from Kevin Johnson, CEO, and Michael Cunningham, CFO, providing further in-depth analysis.\n\nInterim results were in line with guided expectations and confirm the major revenue growth in place, offering strong gross margins, with funding in place to expand. The major OEM 8 new contract is being taken to the start of production more rapidly than typical of other OEM contracts but the start date has been moved a few months later, probably just into 2022. The overall quantum is not affected; indeed, Surface Transforms indicates the risk is distinctly on the upside here. The new manufacturing strategy announcement of 2 September 2021 pointed to management's revenue profile expectations: \"at the time of the fundraising we said that we thought there could be sufficient demand to fill the Knowsley factory by 2025 (\u00a375m sales), albeit these projections are still uncontracted\u2026we have now concluded that we may want this capacity by 2024\". Management states \u00a350m pa sales is currently indicated as the potential, which is derived exclusively from current customer discussions and carry over trade (namely new models from existing customers).\u00a0By 2024, \u00a325m pa sales is indicated under current live contracts, with much more anticipated on top of this from imminent new contracts.\n\nThis is a knowledge company, with high growth in a high growth market. Research expenses, including employees to PhD level, have always been a strong part of the equation to underpin growth. Surface Transforms is an applied metallurgy, chemistry and manufacturing process. 1H21 R&D increased 32%.\u00a0There is only one competitor, a monopolistic supplier with 97% of the global market, falling to 93% next year. There are cogent arguments that this competitor product is outperformed by the ST product. There is no indication of a commercial third supplier and lead times are very many years; thus, additional competition would appear to be many years off.\n\nImportant notice:\n\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

Jonathan Laredo and Charles Peach joined Hardman & Co\u2019s property analyst Mike Foster in a live event following strong full year results.\n\nYew Grove reviewed its latest interim results, which showed a raised dividend and a 2.4% like-for-like upward revaluation of its investment properties (a rise over a six-month period). It also raised further growth equity and secured acquisitions from within its extensive pipeline of potential opportunities. A number of interesting points were made in the presentation and it is worth highlighting that all metrics have been pointing in the right direction.\n\nThe mix of assets \u2013 all in the Republic of Ireland \u2013 comprises offices and industrial. However, the latter has two distinct categories, namely life science tenanted assets and 'traditional light industrial'. These two seem to be valued at broadly similar levels, which we find interesting and may bring useful medium-term value uplifts as Yew Grove has high exposure to life science tenants. The extensive details Yew Grove provided on the dynamics behind its strong results provided a robust foundation to the positioning for its portfolio growth. Yew Grove has shareholder approval for a \u20ac100m equity raising this year.\n\nImportant notice:\n\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

With liquidity being a top priority for many small to mid-cap companies, it is an area of the shareholder register that can no longer go overlooked by investor relations. Technology and platform development remain at the forefront of Research Tree's goals, which leaves the company advantageously placed to make an incremental difference in investor access.\n\nRobert and Larissa also touch on MiFID II, the effects this has had on small-cap research coverage, and where this leaves companies like Research Tree on the other side of regulatory changes.\n\nImportant notice:\n\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

They address, too, the very real risks about its financeability if interest rates were to rise sharply. \n\nMost significantly, PSND has doubled over the last decade, having broken the \u00a31tr barrier as recently as 2011. The financial crisis and subsequent recession of 2008/09 and, more recently, COVID-19 have been key factors.  \n\nThe combination of rising inflation and likely rises in interest rates pose real risks. Moreover, there seems little inclination on the part of government to rein in public expenditure growth. \n\nWhilst in recent years, PSND has been readily financed, this may not always be the case - think the mid-1970s and the controversial IMF loan. Interest rates may rise by well over 1% - the Treasury estimates that a 1% rise alone would cost close to \u00a328bn per year in higher interest rate payments. Do not forget either the ca.\u00a31.9tr public sector pension deficit which is outside the PSND figures.\n\n\nImportant notice:\n\nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

The webinar was a compelling 50-minute discussion on PIP\u2019s portfolio and performance, including topical private equity sector themes, and rounded off with an engaging number of questions from the live audience.\n\nWhilst explaining PIP\u2019s well positioned and COVID-mitigated portfolio, Helen expanded on why PIP has chosen technology and tech-enabled businesses as one focus for investment. Drawing insights from the latest McKinsey report on sector buyouts, Helen highlighted its resilience, diversity, and extensive value creation through the growth of digital assets, low capital intensity and recurring revenues. Moving to the investment case for PIP, Helen noted the exceptional performance since inception (11.7% NAV growth since inception, generating twice the return of the FTSE All Share over 5 and 10 years). Sharing some valuable insights into private equity as a sector given her extensive experience, Helen illustrated how ESG within PE adds value both for investors and society, and the ways in which investors can navigate their way through PE investing.\n\nImportant notice: \nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

He joined Hardman & Co\u2019s property analyst Mike Foster for a live presentation and plentiful Q&A.\n\nThe audience heard how the business has enhanced its returns, buying bonds and entering into new senior debt positions at stronger-than-previous rates. Ravi outlined specific examples of how RECI had addressed its positions in its most COVID-exposed areas (i.e. hotels). It was interesting to hear the view that tall offices with high seating densities were a totally different (and less attractive) asset class than lower rise, lower density offices. \n\nThere are clear target markets and differentiated types of proposition (core, value-add, developer) but within these broad structures, it is the expertise of the substantial Cheyne team rather than proscriptive allocation models which allow RECI to add value, especially in the COVID-19 situation.\n\nImportant notice: \nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

The market dynamics in the Republic of Ireland are particularly strong, as the country enjoys the strongest economic growth in Europe. A huge beneficiary of FDI, the economy posted 3.4% GDP growth in 2020 through COVID-19.\n\nYew Grove\u2019s modern industrial and office assets outside of central Dublin have attracted a rosta of multinational and government tenants. The company achieved almost full rent collection over COVID and uniquely posted a rise in NAV as a result of revaluation and rental increases. There is a strong pipeline of opportunities going forward, which would likely require additional capital. The discussion topics broadened into competition for assets, scope of any future capital raise, evidence of emergence of a hub and spoke model in Dublin.\n\nImportant notice: \nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

    "description": "With their latest standout results behind them, we were delighted to spend time with Oakley Capital Investment\u2019s Steven Tredget (Partner) for a discussion webinar on Hardman Talks. Hardman & Co\u2019s Head of Investment Company research, Mark Thomas, hosted the event, starting off by sharing his sector insights on private equity.\n\nMark highlighted the competitive advantage for the underlying companies in uncertain times with access to more certain funding and operational expertise that are provided by PE firms. Steven explored the key strength for Oakley Capital, its relationships with a network of entrepreneurs who help originate and manage their investments. The impressive EBITDA growth of 20% in OCI investee companies is a huge outperformance against the MSCI, but moreover highlights the sustainability of OCI\u2019s returns since inception. With ten out of the (then) 17 companies in the portfolio having experienced either a neutral or positive impact on their businesses through COVID-19, the pandemic headwinds have been managed carefully within the portfolio. The discussion topics broadened into why high levels of return are expected going forward, how new investments are assessed and current opportunities, the valuation of assets, and extensive comments on discount management.\n\nAs the first \u2018discussion style\u2019 live event, we were pleased to welcome one of the largest audiences we have seen on the Hardman Talks series. We look forward to hosting OCI back on our channel in the near future.\n\nImportant notice: \nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

Find out more here: www.hardmanandco.com/hardman-co-investor-forum-february-2021\n\nTritax EuroBox invests in very large logistics assets on prime sites on the continent, which are crucial to the growing and lengthening supply chain networks of logistics companies and online retailers.\n\nNick Preston, CEO of Tritax EuroBox, presented the company as the European logistics real estate investment company, adding value to investors through their innovative acquisitions and asset management in a highly supportive market.\n\nThe wave of online retailing and digitalisation has changed the dynamics of the logistics market, proving highly favourable for EuroBox and its tenants. Operationally, Nick shared with investors that 100% of their assets are income producing. These resilient and growing income streams underpin returns and future expansion may target assets at earlier stages of development, thus boosting yields further.\n\nThe live audience took interest in the investment trust with questions coming in about the gearing for further expansion, premium to NAV, key differences between EuroBox and the other Tritax (BigBox, which focuses on the UK), and about the relationship with Aberdeen Standard Life.\n\nImportant notice: \nThis content has been prepared purely for information purposes, and should not be construed as an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any security, product, service or investment.

An audience of 60 sophisticated investors heard from 4 distinct companies:\n\nPresenting Companies:\n\nSevern Trent (SVT): is one of the 10 water companies privatised in 1989 - only three, including Severn Trent, remain publicly-quoted. Based in the Midlands, Severn Trent supplies some 4.3 million homes and businesses with water and sewerage services. Currently, the Water Regulator, Ofwat, is undertaking a major price review, which will impact from April 2020. Possible sector renationalisation, by a future Labour Government, is also a live issue.\n\nVolta Finance (VTA): is a closed-ended, limited liability company registered in Guernsey. Volta has a flexible mandate to invest in all types of ollateralized loan obligation exposure with the underlying portfolio being around 700 mainly corporate credits. The rolling 12-month dividend is \u20ac0.62, per share generating a yield of around 9%. The investment manager is AXA Investment Managers Paris, which has a team of experts concentrating on the structured finance markets.\n\nResidential Secure Income (RESI): Residential Secure Income is a REIT which invests in specialist UK housing. The strategy is to generate an 8% annual return including 5% as dividends, through having acquired three secure streams of income which have similar but distinct characteristics. This brings the resilience of low-correlated risks, with scope for capital value uplift. Private sector sheltered retirement housing has exceptionally restricted supply for rent. Acquisition yields tend to be more attractive on the less-commonly traded real estate asset classes. The other main asset is shared ownership for rent, where hurdles to institutional buyers are steep.\n\nCalculus Capital: is one of the longest standing investors in the tax advantaged industry, having launched its first EIS fund in 1999. Its focus is on building diversified portfolios of smaller, unquoted, UK growth businesses and giving investors the opportunity to have exposure to these through the Calculus VCT or EIS Fund.",

Alternative investments are becoming more mainstream, as the reduction in pension cap and need for portfolio diversification strengthens this area.\n\nOf particular note is how advisers carry out due diligence on behalf of their clients. To help in this crucial area, this CPD-qualifying seminar was organized to help advisors understand the background of these regulatory changes and how to ensure that they have an effective due diligence process in place.\n\nWe were joined by Mark Brownridge, Director General of the EIS Association, who provided an overview of the impact of MiFID II on EIS investment, as well as the recent FCA report into anti-competitive risks and use of independent reviews. We were also partnered with Paul Mattick and Russell Fryer from Mercia Tech in creating this event.",
