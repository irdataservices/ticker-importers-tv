We have several decades of involvement and experience of the stock market, stocks, shares, funds, fundamental analysis, technical analysis and dealing with volatility. We are Full Time Investors who find the day-to-day rigours of the ever-changing quest to make financial returns from the increasingly volatile markets fascinating. Just for clarity other than when we are presenting Twin Petes Investing LIVE at events as we have been fortunate to do at Mello Events, we are conducting our podcasts from completely different locations, with one of us in Windsor, Berkshire and the other in Leicestershire.\n\nYou can find our audio Twin Petes Investing podcasts on the following platforms:\nSoundcloud https://soundcloud.com/user-479955511...\nAudioBoom https://audioboom.com/channels/493739...\nApple iTunes https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast....\nSpotify https://open.spotify.com/show/2G8k3SU....\nAmazon Music https://music.amazon.co.uk/podcasts/d...\nOvercast https://overcast.fm/itunes1384481834/....\nGoogle https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0....\nPLEASE SUBSCRIBE to one of those audio channels and this YOUTUBE for future investing related videos.",
