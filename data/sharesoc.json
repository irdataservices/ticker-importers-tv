    "description": "European Green Transition plc (EGT)\nEuropean Green Transition plc is a business operating in the green economy transition space in Europe. EGT intends to capitalise on the opportunities created by Europe's transition away from fossil fuels to a green, renewables-focused economy. The Company plans to expand its existing portfolio of green economy assets through M&A, targeting what it believes to be distressed and undervalued projects. EGT sees substantial opportunities to deliver value from its M&A pipeline, which includes critical material, wind, solar, processing and recycling projects.\nThe Company's current portfolio of green economy assets includes the Olserum Rare Earth Project in Sweden. EGT has taken an exclusive option over a copper tailings recycling project in Cyprus with the potential to generate meaningful amounts of copper, and with the site and surroundings offering an excellent long-term location to establish a potential solar power facility. EGT has taken a further exclusive option to develop a peatland carbon sink programme and in turn generate carbon credits at Altan in Donegal in the northwest of Ireland. EGT owns additional projects in northern Sweden and Germany which have defined and tangible upside with potential to realise near-term inflection points in a cost effective manner. EGT's objective is to build a profitable business while aiming to monetise some of its assets through sale or partnership with larger industry players or European end users. The team is focused on success while remaining committed to its defined ESG strategy, ensuring excellent development practices across all projects in addition to regular local community engagement.\n\nAltona Rare Earths (REE)\nAltona Rare Earths is a resource exploration and development company focused on critical raw materials in Africa. Altona is listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange with the ticker \"REE\". Rare Earths are a group of 17 chemical elements, many of which are critical to the World's ongoing transition from carbon-based to renewable energies, and to the defence and communication sectors.\nAltona is currently developing Monte Muambe, its flagship Magnet Rare Earths Project,\nlocated in Northwest Mozambique. The Project was acquired in June 2021, and Altona has so far drilled over 7,800m, and defined a maiden JORC Mineral Resource Estimate of 13.6 million tons at 2.42% TREO. A Competent Person Report including the Scoping Study for Monte Muambe was published on 18 October 2023. The Project is now at Prefeasibility Study stage, with a mining concession application in process, and a focus on metallurgical testing and process.\nAltona is presently diversifying its portfolio by acquiring a limited number of critical raw material projects to complement Monte Muambe. The acquisition of the Kabompo South copper project in Zambia and of the Sesana copper-silver project in Botswana represents the first steps towards the implementation of this expanded strategy."
