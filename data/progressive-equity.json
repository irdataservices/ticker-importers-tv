This confirmed that the old world order has moved to a new one involving power projection by strong men operating in their own economic and strategic interests. Europe, the UN, and NATO are not involved.\n\nStarmer's meeting with Trump will be a career-defining event for him and a pivotal opportunity for the UK as a potential bridge between the US and the rest of Europe at this critical juncture for the West.\n\nIt also represents Trump's desire to tidy up Ukraine and Gaza to get to his main match-up, the strongman heavyweight contest between the US and China.\n\nXi has been boosting China's stock market and technology sector through a symbolic handshake with Jack Ma at a conference this week. The pair infamously fell out in 2021, with Ma disappearing from public view for a couple of years.\n\nAlibaba shares and the wider Chinese stock market have performed much better than the US Mag Seven over the last month but remain well below their peak values of 4 years ago.\n\nGold had another strong week, and Trump says he is going to Fort Knox to check that the gold is still there.\n\nJapan records much higher inflation, which seems to require much higher rates. However, the yen carry trade worries of last summer have not recurred.\n\nIn the UK, there remains mixed economic data, but, on balance, there is less likelihood of significantly lower rates soon as inflation trends up for the next few months.\n\nGareth runs through the week in company news, with caution from Thruvision and Zoo Digital and positive updates from Oxford Metrics, Beeks and Springfield Property.\n\nThe main event will be the German election on Sunday, which will have consequences for wider European politics, but don't expect things to happen quickly.\n\nThere are some US GDP and PCE inflation data, but the headlines will likely remain dominated by politics, with Starmer's trip to DC and Trump checking his gold reserves in Texas.\n\nBrought to you byProgressive Equity ( https://progressive-research.com/ ).\n\nThe Market Call \nEpisode 110\nFebruary 21, 2025\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/8dd6a85b"

He also considers small-cap silicon play, Ensilica, a real tech company with the wrong balance sheet.

    "description": "This week, Gareth ( https://progressive-research.com/people/gareth-evans/ ) and Jeremy ( https://progressive-research.com/people/jeremy-mckeown/ ) tackle the investment implications of Trump 2.0. After shocking the world with his suggestion of turning Gaza into the Riveria of the Middle East, Trump has moved on to Ukraine. Such events illustrate how the accepted World order has broken down. Where is the UN in all of this?\n\nOne outcome has been a new all-time high in the gold price, indicating heightened risks and uncertainties for global investors. The US inflation data also came in hot. Yet, counter-intuitively, it didn't dent the gold bull market, indicating perhaps investor concerns over policy errors or breakdown in the relationship between the Treasury and the Fed.\n\nRelative to other monetary metals, gold looks expensive, and silver or platinum might offer better opportunities to protect against fiat money debasement. Not advice; do your own research.\n\nChina's equity values have recovered strongly after the Deep Seek AI revelations. Alibaba's stock has risen over 40% in less than a month, indicating the impact of the dispersal trade.\n\nThe UK economy unexpectedly grew in Q4 last year. While negative sentiment surrounds the economy, UK assets remain relatively attractive to global investors.\n\nThis week, one example of how the UK government prioritises economic growth is emerging in the newsflow of the motor finance and retail sectors.\n\nWith significant exposure to car loans, Close Brothers and SU made constructive updates this week, indicating that motor finance might avoid the protracted drag on consumer lending that PPI became.\n\nGareth covers the impact of government policy onSecure Trust Bank ( https://progressive-research.com/research/commercial-finance-positioned-for-continued-growth/ ) and Vertu Motors ( https://progressive-research.com/research/zev-mandate-impact-on-new-and-used-cars/ ).\n\nLooking ahead, we will get UK inflation data next week, which is likely to indicate a flat annual rate of 2.5%.\n\nAlso, we get Japanese inflation data, and the accompanying risk of the yen carry-trade unwind.\n\nBrought to you byProgressive Equity ( https://progressive-research.com/ ).\n\nThe Market Call \nEpisode 109\nFebruary 14, 2025\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8d8bbd4"

    "description": "During the pandemic, an Argentinian economist called Javier Milei began to make a name for himself on TV panel shows for his wild libertarian ideas and idiosyncratic, abrasive delivery. Milei raged against politicians of all persuasions, always prepared to outrage his opponents and entertain his audiences.\n\nBy 2021, he had become a congressman, denouncing the political class as useless parasites who had never worked and thought only of self-enrichment. He assured his electorate that he would kick these criminals out. He didn't seek to lead lambs, he told them, but to awaken lions, and the lions he awoke were younger people attracted to his unique combination of in-depth economic knowledge and flamboyant shock-jock delivery.\n\nWhile other politicians and the mainstream media depicted him as a performative clown, Milei had taught economics for twenty years and published over fifty academic papers. Unlike most academics, Milei was a showman, playing drums for a Rolling Stones cover band. He was an evangelist who sold out increasingly large venues, lecturing his audiences about the workings of the price mechanism, the moral justification for capitalism, and the crime of collectivism while raising a sense of moral outrage.\n\nThe coincidence of Argentina's economic cycle of despair with Milei's arrival as a chainsaw-wielding showman, backed up by the deep conviction that he knew the solution to his country's woes, unexpectedly led him to the highest office in the land in less than a year. Last December, he became Argentina's 59th president. He won the largest number of votes and the largest percentage of votes recorded in any election since the transition to democracy, but it came with only a minority position in the legislature.\n\nThis left him with an enormous challenge in executing his reforms, but despite this, his first year in office has been largely successful. Unanswered are the questions as to whether Milei's remedies will prove sustainable, whether this time will differ from all the other times, and whether he can end Argentina's era of missed opportunities. Can he continue painful reforms while remaining sufficiently popular to complete the project?\n\nI spent a few days in Buenos Aries in early November to learn more about this man and the libertarian experiment he was implementing. I met several people there, including Robert Marstrand, an author and investor who writes the investment stack OfWealth ( https://ofwealth.substack.com/ ).\n\nRobert has a background in investment banking and has lived in Argentina for 16 years. He was very generous with his time and explained the opportunity for Argentina and how investors might like to think about this Maverick nation with its maverick president.\n\nPlease enjoy our conversation about Argentina and its maverick president.\n\nIn the Company of Mavericks \nEpisode 60\nDecember 26, 2024\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/7e28c52c\n\n\u2605 Additional episodes: http://www.inthecompanyofmavericks.com"

Is this the end of the Trump Trade? Maybe, and perhaps not a bad thing for the UK market. The DXY index is the gauge of how this might play out.\n\nIn the UK, higher inflation is partly driven by higher wage settlements, which running at twice inflations rate unsurprisingly led to the BOE decision to keep rates on hold this month. Stubborn inflation is a feature of both sides of the Atlantic.\nIn the UK, the 10-year gilt yields are at levels not previously seen for over 20 years, surpassing the Truss tantrum level of two years ago.\n\nIn other news, Japan kept its rates on hold, and China needs to stimulate further but is playing a waiting game. Putin suggests he is prepared to meet Trump, and the incoming US administration has shown it is prepared to play hardball over the debt ceiling brinkmanship, threatening to close the government down over the holiday break.\n\nIn company news, Gareth discusses a major contract win forIdox ( https://progressive-research.com/research/exciting-contract-win/ ), and Petro Matad's ( https://progressive-research.com/research/on-the-way-up-in-2025/ ) progress and improving outlook for 2025.\nJeremy shares an update on his painful investment in Artisanal Spirits ( https://artisanal-spirits.com/ ).

    "description": "This week, Gareth ( https://progressive-research.com/people/gareth-evans/ ) and Jeremy ( https://progressive-research.com/people/jeremy-mckeown/ ) discuss the new world order emerging ahead of The Donald's arrival. The end of 50 years of the Assad regime in Syria is a win for Turkey and Israel but leaves uncertainty surrounding the country and the region's future direction. China signals that its leadership is prepared to accept a lower yuan to counter the prospect of higher tariffs. However, for markets, it is all about the Trump trade with roaring risk assets on Wall Street. Investors assume that Musk's DOGE project has already caused the deficit to disappear. This looks overly optimistic.\n\nThe Labour government is enacting its own version of DOGE-lite in the UK. This week, the prime minister criticised Whitehall for its unacceptable \"tepid bath of managed decline.\"\n\nIn the UK market, they discuss updates from housing beneficiaries Van Elle ( https://progressive-research.com/research/strong-housebuilding-underpins-fy25-outlook/ )and Springfield Properties ( https://progressive-research.com/research/outlook-confirmed-as-buyer-confidence-returns/ ).\n\nAs Ahstead exits the FTSE 100, having worked its way up from near extinction 30 years ago, Games Workshop appears for the first time. From a single shop in Hammersmith, GAW has become a global content creator, and to mark the occasion, it has agreed a landmark TV and film deal with Amazon.\n\nAlphawave Semi further complicated its relationship with the UK market by launching a convertible bond issue. S&U highlighted the motor finance industry's regulatory and legal issues. At the same time, Close Brothers and others saw large intraday price moves as the courts gave the plaintiffs leave to appeal against the FCA allegations the industry faces. Perhaps we are near the bottom of this story.\n\nLooking ahead, the UK GDP data shows that the growth rate is slowing from 1.6% to 1.3% yearly. Next week, rate decisions will be made in the US, the UK, and Japan. The BoJ probably retains the largest element of surprise.\n\nBrought to you byProgressive Equity ( https://progressive-research.com/ ).\n\nThe Market Call \nEpisode 102\nDecember 13, 2024\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/8a20e03a"

He outlines a couple of examples of stocks he and his team have successfully shorted that turned out to be deceptions.\n\nWe then discuss two long positions he recently added to his portfolio. Genus, a UK\u2013listed animal genetics company, Genus ( https://www.genusplc.com/ ) and Paradox Interactive ( https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/investors ), a Scandinavian-listed games publisher\n\nRichard then discusses the geographic spread of his fund and how to think about market inefficiency driven by the rise of the mega-cap tech stocks, passive investment and meme-driven markets.\n\nAnd\u2026 importantly, how to adapt investment strategy in a market that can remain inefficient for a long time.\n\nThis is a masterclass in the often counterintuitive art of managing an absolute return strategy in a volatile and illiquid asset class.\n\nWhile not for everyone, it can offer downside protection in choppy markets while providing long-term exposure to quality compounding equities.\n\nI must remind you that this is only for information purposes and is NOT investment advice. The views expressed in the podcast are personal to the contributors and do not represent Progressive Equity's views.\n\nPlease enjoy our conversation with Richard Stuckey.\n\nMade possible by Progressive Equity ( https://progressive-research.com/ ).\n\nIn the Company of Mavericks \nEpisode 59\nDecember 13, 2024\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/2c8bd14a\n\n\u2605 Additional episodes: http://www.inthecompanyofmavericks.com"

But it also now has the opportunity in smart manufacturing.\nHistorically Oxford Metrics has had strong positions in relatively small global markets, the move into smart manufacturing offers the opportunity to build a significantly bigger business in an application that is at a technological tipping point. A classic growth hardware and electronics story that needs good acquisitions and good execution.\nFD Technologies (FDP) is focusing down upon its KX database business. The market looks to have picked up on the Total Addressable Market not the Serviceable Obtainable Market. Huge difference, and one that the management themselves don\u2019t seem to have a grip on yet. On top of that its investors (or management) could well be killing the hypothetical golden goose.\nIf you want companies with growth valuations you have to give them the funds to drive the growth. The valuation suggests huge market opportunity, and there clearly is a significant one. However, the limited cash allocated after the post disposal distributions to drive sales suggests nothing of the sort. Tens of millions of sales and marketing will deliver exactly that in terms of revenues. Something\u2019s got to give.\n\nTime Stamps:\n00:00 Introduction\n01:15 Oxford Metrics (OMG)\n07:38 FD Technologies\n\nTalking Tech\nEpisode 13\nDecember 9, 2024\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/de938d7b"

His wide-ranging portfolio includes interests in NASDAQ-listed Gambling.com ( https://www.gambling.com/about-us?_gl=1*1qewq7p*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTU5NjI3NzI5NS4xNzMyNzg0MDk5*_ga_K8RELFQJ0T*MTczMjc4NDA5OS4xLjAuMTczMjc4NDA5OS4wLjAuMTk1ODMwODM3Mw.. ) and the UK-listed small-caps Gaming Realms ( https://www.gamingrealms.com/about/ ), B90 ( https://www.b90holdings.com/ ) and Good Life Plus ( https://investors.goodlifeplus.co.uk/about-us/ ).\n\nAmong his private investments, Mark has stakes in platform, payment, ag-tech, and ed-tech businesses.\n\nHe discusses his interest in quantitative analysis, improving operating efficiencies and working with entrepreneurs who are prepared to listen and take advice.\n\nThis is a fascinating conversation with many lessons and reminders of how technology can change industries AND how a changing regulatory environment can create radical uncertainty and existential risk. Mark talks openly about his eventful journey from a traditional bricks-and-mortar bookmaker to a seasoned VC and investor.\n\nI must remind you that none of what you are about to hear is investment advice, but it is solely for your information and entertainment.

Equity investors, on the other hand, have shown relief that AIM's IHT benefits are largely intact following Wednesday. But it was a \"big\" Budget with lots of new tax, and lots of near-term expenditure without lots of detail or reassurance around the detail or the benefit of much of that spending.\n\nElsewhere, oil prices have tumbled, Japan has lurched to another political crisis, and gold, silver and bitcoin are all strong. US tech Q3 has been good, but not good enough for investors - stocks have fallen on relatively \"in line\" trading.\n\nIn the UK, we've seen a flurry of small deals - three Progressive clients (Vertu Motors, Van Elle and SDI) all bought UK-based businesses where the vendors may have been hurrying to beat any Budget changes to Capital Gains Tax. Even discounting the Budget flurry, there does seem to have been a modest pickup in market activity.\n\nFollowing the recording of the podcast, Friday's US non-farm payrolls figure was weak...a gift for Donald Trump who can point to a weakening economy. Next week obviously sees the US election - plus rate decisions in both the UK and USA on Thursday, where 0.25% reductions are expected...although the lower-rate trajectory might be less clear than previously hoped. ----------------- Brought to you by Progressive Equity ( https://progressive-research.com/ )\n\nThe Market Call \nEpisode 96\nNovember 1, 2024\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/b1c55e2e"

    "description": "Have you ever wondered what investing in Emerging Markets is all about? It\u2019s complicated, right? And having witnessed a decade or more of US dollar dominance and outperforming developed markets, particularly US markets, why bother looking at the rest of the world? After all, isn\u2019t that where all the bad stuff happens, like currency crises and debt defaults?\n\nRecently, there have been signs that Emerging Markets might be re-emerging. This year, there have been signs that the dollar\u2019s dominance may not be so dominant. Following the Fed\u2019s decision to cut rates by 50 basis points, China announced an intention to add significant heft to its policy of loosening monetary and fiscal conditions in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nFollowing an extended period of being considered uninvestable, Chinese equities had a near 30% bounce in a couple of weeks. Was this just some hasty short closing or a re-awakening of the biggest emerging markets? This is currently one of the fiercest debates among global investors.\n\nI wanted to get the perspective of an emerging markets expert, so I was delighted to have the chance to speak withLeila Kardouche of Variis Partners ( https://www.variispartners.co.uk/about-5 ). Leila is a veteran of the space, and she and her small team recently launched a new London-based emerging markets partnership. This partnership fills a space left by several high-profile investors who have recently left this area due to its long period of disappointing returns.\n\nIn this episode, we learn about the structure of Emerging Markets and how benchmark indices such as the MSCI are not very helpful in uncovering the full potential of the growth opportunities often obscured within these markets. Among other things, Leila discusses how to evaluate political risk in this widely diverse range of markets as we tour what\u2019s hot and what\u2019s not in an investment universe covering 85% of the world\u2019s population.\n\nCritically, Leila and the Variis team focus on stock selection. Leila discusses how the challenges of growing businesses in emerging markets have produced some very successful compounding growth opportunities. Yes, these companies have outperformed strongly even within markets like China, which has been disappointing overall.\n\nFor my recent Substack covering emerging markets, please see, Are Emerging Markets Re-emerging?

In the UK the new Labour government\u2019s policies were outlined in the King\u2019s Speech, with much talk around changes to the planning process and the likely positive repercussions for UK housebuilders and the construction sector as a whole. Trump\u2019s near assassination, recovery and then announcement of Vance as his running mate in the VP slot, gave plenty more to discuss. They talk about the rise of JD Vance and his links to various tech billionaires, then contemplate what a second \u2018Trump Trade\u2019 and \u2018MAGA\u2019 regime might look like, and what the repercussions might be for the Fed, the US and the rest of the global economy. Yield curves have already steepened and the USD weakened, whilst gold prices reached a new all-time high and there began to be a discernible swing in the equity markets from large cap to small cap. In China weaker GDP data in the second quarter continued to trouble the rest of the world. In the US inflation was heading in the right direction towards the 2% target and UK inflation remained on target at 2%, with UK unemployment rates unchanged and a period of real wage growth continuing.

    "description": "While today's financial news coverage focused on the Autumn Statement, probably the most significant economic news yesterday was the postponement of the OPEC+ meeting this weekend. With signs of fracturing within the cartel, this casts doubt on its ability to implement production cuts. In a demonstration of the fragility in the world's most critical and rigged energy market, benchmark oil prices fell over 5% on the news, albeit they recovered later.\nThe recent decline in global energy prices went unnoticed by the UK's OFGEM energy regulator, which announced that the UK retail energy price cap would rise by 5% in the new year.\nAs the US takes its Thanksgiving holiday, the UK is busy absorbing yesterday's Autumn Statement. As usual, the Chancellor pulled fewer rabbits from his hat than the build-up suggested. The political theatre attached to this event ramps up as election year approaches.\nIn summary, the giveaways, such as NI reductions and increased investment allowances, were less than the inflationary-fueled fiscal drag on tax revenues. Hence, the UK will still have its highest tax take as a proportion of GDP since World War Two.\nHowever, it is worth noting that the UK's GDP is a full 2%age points higher than that forecasted by the OBR only six months ago.\nThere were no new measures to address the functioning of the UK's capital markets. And the only direct action for stock market investors was a plan to revive the If You See Sid campaign to widen share ownership and sell off the Exchequers' remaining holding in Nat West Bank to retail investors. This holding in Nat West is a hangover from the Global Financial Crisis, which the government has struggled to offload to institutional investors for the last 14 years. It was recently embroiled in the \"debanking\" scandal that cost it its CEO. Perhaps the campaign should be renamed If You See Nigel, Please Don't Tell Him.\nMotorpoint Retail, the used car supermarket, reported significant H1 revenue and profit declines, driven by lower volumes and a fall in finance commissions. It also suffered an increase in finance expenses during the period. More recently, it has seen reduced wholesale used car prices of about 6% in just the last six weeks, more deflationary signals.\nPrognosticator\n\nThe Market Call \nEpisode 36\nNovember 23, 2023\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/389dbe81"

The new Labour government's honeymoon period is underway, and they are looking busy, but will it last forever?\n\nThere are emerging signs that the unwinding of the concentrated US tech rally might lead to a dispersal of returns to smaller, more value-oriented equities.

What a difference some liquidity makes.\n\nThe UK's M&A train rolls on with Royal Mail owner, IDS has agreed a 370p offer from Daniel Kretinsky.\n\nThey discuss DP Poland ( https://progressive-research.com/research/still-hot/ ), Petro Matad ( https://progressive-research.com/research/local-approvals-received-ready-to-roll/ ), Tern ( https://progressive-research.com/research/significantly-improved-kpis/ ) and TinyBuild ( https://progressive-research.com/research/the-big-rebuild/ ).\n\nNext week's highlights are expected to include the ECB's decision to lower rates and employment data from the US.\n\nMade possible byProgressive Equity ( https://progressive-research.com/ ).\n\nThe Market Call \nEpisode 74\nMay 31, 2024\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/410c71d8"

Scott talks about market performance in Q1 2024. Where have markets come from, how have they performed in Q1, and where are they going? Bond yields have risen, inflation is sticky, and rates are higher for longer. Equities have had a good quarter, albeit the Magnificent Seven have not been quite so magnificent. The UK, by comparison, has been lacklustre. Gold has been the Q1 showstopper, and the main buyer seems to have been China's central bank, the POBC. Are they about to devalue the Red Cabbage or launch a military campaign?\n\nIn Q1, small caps underperformed large caps in Q1 in UK and US. The UK IPO market remains moribund. There have been more deaths than births in the UK market YTD. Is the UK stock market just a dumpster fire, or can it recover? Gareth is hopeful for a recovery.\n\nJeremy highlights the Middle East conflict, its limited impact on financial markets, and what to look for going forward. The big news is UK inflation, but he remains sceptical that the UK will cut rates ahead of the Fed.\n\nGareth discusses the week's company news, highlighting the Severfield ( https://progressive-research.com/research/step-change-in-european-and-indian-outlook/ ) results with a strong order book and a share buyback.\n\nIn next week's news, Jeremy highlights US PCE inflation data and the Bank of Japan's interest rate decision.\n\nBrought to you by Progressive Equity ( https://progressive-research.com/ ).\n\nThe Market Call \nEpisode 68\nApril 19, 2024\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/119aa567"

Other companies discussed include Concurrent Technologies, IG Design, Revolution Bars, Smiths News, Shell and Alpha Financial Markets.\n\nWith things seemingly looking up and signs that capital is beginning to flow back slowly into the market, Jeremy looks to next week when the UK will hear the Bank of England's rate decision, and Q1 GDP data will be released.\n\nBrought to you by Progressive Equity ( https://progressive-research.com/ ).\n\nIf you'd like to hear more from Alastair Stewart, read his daily Property & Construction sector update here ( https://progressive-research.com/insights/category/property-construction-daily/ ).

Is negative QT the same as QE? The effect is the same.\n\nThe BoE is pretty explicitly steering towards a rate cut at the next meeting in June. Lower mortgage rates are on the horizon, and the feel-good factor is returning, albeit too little, too late for the current government. This makes the general election call likely to be later, not sooner.\n\nMeanwhile, China is steadily working through its problems, and its manufacturing recovery is slowly coming through. China is supplying the West with cheaper manufactured goods such as EVs, which is incrementally deflationary but has political implications.\n\nIn the UK, they discuss Informa as an example of UK B2B media companies having inherent value to the AI giants. Informa has done a deal with Microsoft. Also, they discuss Wetherspoon's colourful update and the experiential leisure provider XP Factory, owner of Escape Hunt and Boom Battle Bar, which continues to grow quickly. Meanwhile, ITV has updated a positive trend in ad revenue year to date, with positive implications for others, including STV in Scotland.\n\nThey discuss the outlook for UK GDP growth (data out after this recording showed decent Q1 GDP growth of 0.6%) and US inflation data. Jeremy compares Argentina's inflation rate, also due next week, to the US, 3.5% versus 300% annualised rate, which for Argentina is historically low!\n\nBrought to you by Progressive Equity ( https://progressive-research.com/ )\n\nThe Market Call \nEpisode 71\nMay 10, 2024\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/3212815c"

Meta and Nvidia share prices are falling, and the Magnificient Seven shows signs of fragmentation. It might be too early to call. Still, there are signs of the global equity market fragmenting. Meanwhile, a new age of realism has replaced accepted ESG ideology in politics and corporate strategy. In this context, they discuss the offer for Anglo American from Aussie miner, BHP. In the UK, results and updates continue to be broadly in line with expectations, the FTSE 100 has moved to an ATH and Filtronic's share price soars into low earth orbit as they sign a remarkable deal with Elon Musk's SpaceX.

The question is whether the BoE or ECB would cut ahead of the Fed. China is exporting deflation. In the UK, GDP grew more than expected in February, and the January figure was revised upwards. In UK equities, there is heightened debate and concern about whether the UK market is fit for purpose, with Shell making noises about relisting in the US. However, UK PLCs continue to carry on, retiring equity and receiving bid approaches. (This week saw an offer for Lok'n'stor and an approach for Centaur Media). However, the UK market issues are more cyclical than structural and can improve quickly on the return of liquidity. Next week's macro highlight will be the UK inflation data, with expectations for a month-on-month fall from 3.4% annualised to 3.1%. A UK set-up with rising GDP, falling inflation, and rate cuts should be positive for UK equities.

    "description": "Macro & Overnight\n\nThe Bitcoin price was more volatile than usual overnight as speculation waxed and waned regarding the SEC\u2019s expected approval of about a dozen applications for ETFs. There remain strong indications that SEC approval will be granted today for ETFs from providers such as Blackrock and Fidelity, among others, despite erroneous reports online that approval had already been granted late yesterday.\n\n\nUK Company News\n\nPersimmon said they anticipate market conditions will remain highly uncertain during 2024, particularly for first-time buyers. However, they note that mortgage rates are beginning to ease, and input costs continue to moderate.\n\nGreggs said that FY23 total sales were up nearly 20%, opening 220 new shops to end the year with 2,473. Inflationary pressures are reducing, and its full-year outcome remains aligned with its previous expectations.\n\nSosander, the female fashion brand, updated on a record quarter with revenue up 23%. Gross margins rose due to reduced promotional activity. Joint CEOs say this continues to validate their multi-channel strategy after successful launches in Australia and Canada, and they plan to open their first UK store this spring. They also reiterated their strategic goal of delivering \u00a3100m+ revenues and a pre-tax profit margin of at least 10% in the medium term.\n\nMarks Electrical updated Q4 revenue growth of 17.8% and increased market share in its retail household appliances and electrical goods categories. However, despite proactive cost action, it warned that product margins did not rise to the expected level with a material impact in the peak trading period, which has had a material impact on profit guidance.\n\nMarks Electrical is a well-run but tricky business to get right. business with an actively involved founder and CEO, Mark Smithson, leading from the front. He is justifiably proud of the 60,000 TrustPilot reviews, with 95% 4 and 5 stars. He knows from 37 years of trading that margin fluctuations are inevitable. These periods present an opportunity to learn, ultimately enabling the Group to create long-term value and position us as the UK\u2019s leading premium electrical retailer. Marks\u2019 focus on the premium end of the market with a small but growing share should be attractive if the UK housing market continues to recover and lead to increased housing transactions. In the meantime, Marks will remain in the investor doghouse.

    "description": "Macro & Overnight\n\nIt\u2019s a quiet day for macro news; investors are focusing on US inflation data later today for clues about the Fed rate decision, where the next FOMC meeting is on January 30th.\n\nThe SEC finally approved Bitcoin ETFs in the US market, widening the scope for investors to access the alternative asset, for example, via 401K pension plans.\n\nThe Winklevoss brothers first proposed a Bitcoin ETF in 2013 when the price was $500. The regulator\u2019s reluctance to sanction this product over the last decade has \u201csaved\u201d US investors from participating in an instrument that has risen 90-fold in dollar terms over the period.\n\n\nUK Company News\n\nTrustpilot expects to report profits above the top end of the range of market expectations. In addition, it continues to deliver strong cash generation and announced plans for a \u00a320m share buyback.\n\nMpac Group, the packaging and automation provider, updated that its H2 revenue and profit were substantially above H1, aided by the normalisation of margins. It had a closing order book of \u00a375.0m (FY22: \u00a367.2m). Its H2 order intake was the highest ever.\n\nGlobalData expects to deliver underlying revenue growth of 7% and EBITDA growth of 28%, with stronger-than-expected margins of 41% versus 36% last year. It is reorganising to operate across three customer-focused divisions \u2013 Healthcare, Consumer, and Technology. Before Christmas, it announced plans to sell a minority stake in its Healthcare business, which accounted for c.36% of revenue, at a valuation of \u00a31.1bn, raising net cash proceeds of approximately \u00a3434m for the group.\n\nGlobalData is among several UK-listed B2B media companies that are realising significant value from their divisional portfolio, in this case by bringing in private equity to take a minority stake in a division, which exposes the UK market\u2019s considerable undervaluation of these assets. The move also delivers Mike Danson, the founder and CEO, the opportunity to fund non-dilutive acquisitions, where he has a strong record.\n\nThis communication is provided for information purposes only, and is not a solicitation or inducement to buy, sell, subscribe, or underwrite securities or units.

Expectations are for the year-on-year headline rate to be unchanged from last month\u2019s 3.2%.\n\nEquity markets were strong overnight, led by US technology. Nvidia was up 6% and announced a new AI chipset for PCs, while the broader US market was in a risk-on mood.\n\nBitcoin continued its upward price move amid growing speculation of SEC permitting spot Bitcoin ETFs as soon as tomorrow.

However, it entered the second half with a much stronger forward-order book. But it also warned that full-year gross margins are now expected to fall from previous expectations due to higher selling incentives and longer sales cycles. Against the backdrop of stabilising interest rates, the Board anticipates a recovery in demand for low-cost housing in the seasonally busier selling period over the coming weeks and months.\n\nGleeson shares and those for other housebuilders led the recovery in the UK market over recent weeks on hopes of lower rates. Today\u2019s news is mixed with confirmation of a strongly recovering top line.

But sticky inflation data from Europe and continuing strong reported US employment trends also raise questions over the speed of future rate cuts.\n\nFor this week, US inflation data on Thursday will likely be the main event and offer critical input for the Fed\u2019s rate decision in March.\n\nThere is also scope for further deflationary evidence in China with its inflation data on Friday.

    "description": "December 18, 2023\n\n\nPowell\u2019s promised punch bowl is good enough for now\n\n\nMacro & Overnight\n\nFollowing the party mood induced by Jay Powell last week, talking about lower rates in 2024, there has, over recent days, been a rearguard action from central bankers to try to remove the punch bowl.\n\nIronically, ECB President Lagarde, who should think about lowering rates more than the Fed, claimed she hadn\u2019t even considered it.\n\nThe Bank of England just cut and pasted the language from previous announcements that the battle against inflation is not over, and rates will be higher for longer.\n\nThe BoE\u2019s reluctance to join Powell\u2019s party may be at least partly because we get UK inflation data on Wednesday, where the headline will be for a further modest decline in the headline rate to circa 4.3%, but with an increase in the underlying core measures.\n\nSuch is the reflexive nature of markets that the mere hint of lower rates next year makes lowering policy rates less necessary, in what former Bank Governor Mervyn King described as the Maradonna effect. Just as England\u2019s defence assumed the great player would shimmy around them, allowing him a straight path from the halfway line to score \u201cthat goal,\u201d so too might central bankers decide that bond market investors have eased financial conditions sufficiently to make lowering rates early next year unnecessary.\n\nHowever, such is the nature of relief rallies that it will take more than this to stop the Santa rally into the year-end.\n\n\nUK Company News\n\nGames Workshop has updated investors on its negotiations with Amazon over exclusive use of its Warhammer IP for films and TV productions. This will undoubtedly be welcome news for Games Workshop\u2019s legion of loyal private shareholders.\n\nProfessional services company RBG has warned that its Legal Services division has not seen its typical H2 seasonal strength. It saw lower activity in Commercial Real Estate and Equity Capital Markets, with transactions delayed into 2024 or cancelled altogether. Its corporate advisory division, Convex Capital, reports transactions taking significantly longer. Although revenue for FY 2023 will be only slightly lower than expectations, EBITDA will be sharply lower at \u00a34m versus last year\u2019s \u00a315.8m due to one-off costs and write-offs.\n\nThe restructuring and right-sizing of RBG involves more significant challenges than first thought. Although HSBC renewed its lending terms last week, slower markets in commercial property, capital markets, and private company M&A are impacting it hard. The company has surplus assets, including office space and litigation assets left over after the Lionfish disposal, but it remains debt-encumbered. Lower rates and revitalised financial market activity can\u2019t come soon enough.\n\nPrognosticator\n\nThis communication is provided for information purposes only, and is not a solicitation or inducement to buy, sell, subscribe, or underwrite securities or units.

The primary beneficiary is Lord Ashcroft and his family interests, but the trend is clear: the UK stock market values companies substantially below that of PE, trade and strategic acquirers. This trend is becoming all too obvious.\n\nDefence electronics supplier Cohort reported revenue up 22%, driven by higher UK MOD sales. It had a record closing order book extending to 2033, with increased defence spending in all regions.\n\nRevolution Beauty has resolved certain historical matters regarding related party transactions with co-founder and 15% shareholder Tom Allsworth.

Annual average earnings growth over the three months to October fell, and job vacancies rose, indicating a softening labour market.\n\nInvestor focus today will be on the US CPI inflation data a day ahead of the Fed\u2019s FOMC rate-setting meeting. Although rates are expected to be put on hold again, the focus will be on clues for the direction and speed of travel for 2024.\n\nIn Japan, slightly higher producer prices allowed BoJ officials to dismiss suggestions of an imminent end to its negative rates policy.\n\n\nUK Company News\n\nIn the UK, another smaller company has announced a potential offer at a significant premium. This time, small and struggling Smartspace, a software provider to the office market, has been approached about an offer at a 144% premium to yesterday\u2019s closing price. At \u00a325m, it is not material in a market context. However, it is illustrative of the UK market\u2019s value.\n\nFRP Advisory, the specialist Restructuring, Corporate Finance, Debt, Forensics and Financial Advisory business, said it is experiencing increased demand for advice. Its restructuring team is much more active than during the same period a year ago. It expects to exceed current consensus market expectations.\n\nHeadlam, the UK\u2019s leading floorcoverings distributor, updated that its results will be broadly in line with expectations. September and October were weaker than expected, but November trading improved. However, volumes and revenue remain below last year, better in the UK but lower in Europe. Operating cost inflation in H2 remains elevated but should moderate next year. Headlam states that UK floor covering volumes are around 20% lower than in 2019 on a rolling 12-month basis.\n\nSosandar, the online women\u2019s clothing brand moving to an omnichannel model, updated that its sales growth had accelerated with better full-price sales, improving gross margins. The rollout of its store estate should allow it to deliver profitable growth with less discounting and accelerated delivery of its medium-term target of \u00a3100m+ revenue and a 10% margin. Market expectations for the year ending 31 March 2024 are currently revenue of \u00a346.8m and PBT of just \u00a3100,000.\n\nSosandar is an example of how difficult it is to create a new fashion brand from scratch.

    "description": "December 14, 2023\n\n\nFed to pivot, Santa rally back on & Music Magpie is reinvented\n\n\nMacro & Overnight\n\nThe Federal Reserve kept Fed funds steady at their 22-year high for a third consecutive meeting but indicated 75 bps reductions in 2024 in its so-called \u201cdot plot\u201d projections.\n\nIn essence, Jay Powell is saying the quiet part out loud. They have been at least thinking about, thinking about lowering rates. They may even be thinking about lowering rates, but the idea of higher for longer has been scrapped. The door that bond investors have been pushing on for the last few weeks has just been opened, allowing bond yields to tumble and risk assets to rise. This is not the pivot, but enough to incite animal spirits all the same.\n\nHowever, there is never a free lunch and policy changes have consequences. As the inflation train has left the station, the next arrival will be the fear of deflation and recession. Eventually, it will be a case of \u201ccareful what you wish for.\u201d\n\nIf the Fed slashed rates by 100 bps next week, risk assets would plummet on fears of the unknown. Central banks can\u2019t afford to lose control or be seen to lose control of the interest rate narrative; governments have a lot of bonds to sell. Overnight sharply rising gold and bitcoin prices suggest this might be a problem for the monetary system.\n\nHowever, the US 10-year Treasury yield is below 4%, a fall of 100 bps in just eight weeks, and the Santa rally is now back on course.\n\nToday, we get rate decisions from the Bank of England and the ECB. They will follow the Fed\u2019s lead on further pauses. But being closer to recession, the language used will be what is interesting.\n\n\nUK Company News\n\nMusic Magpie has updated that its consumer technology revenues for H2 were up 7.5% over the same H2 period in 2022, with rental subscribers growing by 21%. Its leverage has been reduced and is mitigated by its growing contracted rental revenue and asset base.\n\nMusic Magpie came to the market two years ago with a de-clutter model turbocharged by lockdown. It has reinvented itself as a mobile phone and consumer device recycling business, feeding the stock for an attractive second-hand phone rental business. Success is oblique, and long-term success goes to the most adaptable. One to keep an eye on.\n\nPrognosticator\n\nThis communication is provided for information purposes only, and is not a solicitation or inducement to buy, sell, subscribe, or underwrite securities or units.

This decline indicates slowing demand from a weak global economy, a lack of OPEC+ unity, and a boost to consumers in oil-consuming countries.\n\nThe $ was up and the \u00a3 weaker while US and UK 10yr yields lowered further, converging on the 4% level, which is 80 bps lower than the August highs.\n\nTogether, these data points indicate a continuing easing of financial conditions globally.\n\nChina\u2019s reported trade data are mixed but offer no respite from the deflationary feel evident elsewhere.\n\n\nUK Company News\n\nSmart Metering Systems has received a recommended offer from PE giant KKR at a 40% premium, valuing SMS at \u00a31.3bn. The relentless takeover of the UK mid-market continues.\n\nPublisher Bloomsbury updated that its revenue is now expected to be comfortably ahead and profit materially ahead of current market expectations.\n\nEnergean, the oil and gas producer focused on the Mediterranean, announced its entry into the Morroccon offshore market via a farm-in agreement over AIM-listed Chariot\u2019s gas development and its associated exploration acreage. This new country entry is well-aligned with Energean\u2019s strategy. The deal includes a $10 million upfront with an option to increase its working interest to 55%.\n\nThe conflict in Israel and Gaza has impacted Energean\u2019s share price amid concerns that the conflict could spread. Its main Karish offshore Israel gas asset has remained operational. It derives most of its income from fixed-price commercial offtake agreements with Israeli utilities, thus protecting it from the lower oil price. This new country entry is a welcome sign of a sensible long-term growth plan and path to diversifying risk in its capital allocation policy.\n\nThe Kelso THG debate rumbles on today, with Kelso issuing another announcement urging the larger THG to break itself up, citing evidence of much higher nutrition business valuations elsewhere.\n\nSDI has reported that its H1 revenue increased marginally despite the expiration of profitable COVID contracts. SDI acquires private companies at discount values to those on the quoted markets. These subsidiaries are then encouraged to grow for the benefit of all stakeholders.

The advance has reversed the recent strength in Japanese stocks and bonds.\n\nJapanese rate normalisation has been talked about many times, but there is growing conviction we are now getting close. The repatriation of Japan\u2019s yield-seeking capital is a source of potential instability for Western debt and equity markets that we ignore at our peril.\n\nThe UK 10-yr Gilt yield is below 4% for the first time since May.\n\nToday\u2019s primary focus will be the US non-farm payroll data, unemployment rate and general household jobs survey. While settling the auto workers\u2019 dispute is disruptive to this data in the short term, the longer-term picture remains that employment conditions are deteriorating.\n\n\nUK Company News\n\nArtisanal Spirits, the owner of the Scotch Malt Whisky Society, has now surpassed 40,000 members. However, its revenue this year will be \u00a32m lower than estimated at \u00a323m. It cites weaker performance in China and slower than anticipated take-up of its 50th-anniversary product range. It remains confident that it can continue to grow profitably in 2024.\n\nHigh-end premium single malt Scotch whisky is not proving to be the inflation hedge hoped. Diageo, owner of Johnnie Walker and Brown-Forman, owner of Jack Daniels, have both recently warned of slowing sales. Luxury consumption is under pressure in different categories, but there are fears of a structural trend away from alcohol consumption as well. Artisanal is barely profitable but has a solid stock-backed balance sheet of maturing stock. Its membership-driven direct-to-consumer model has value, but cashflows and values are declining in the short term, and the share price is off sharply this morning.\n\nPrognosticator\n\nThis communication is provided for information purposes only, and is not a solicitation or inducement to buy, sell, subscribe, or underwrite securities or units.

While the US soft landing narrative remains intact, the world economy is walking a fine line between deflationary recession and re-emergent inflation. How the world\u2019s governments finance their growing debt burdens in this sensitive environment adds further complications. But investors will, this week, get some important new data points to fix our position on this delicate path.\n\nTop billing goes to interest rate decisions from the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday, followed by the Bank of England and the ECB on Thursday.\n\nAll three central banks will leave rates unchanged and take the opportunity to remind investors that rates can still rise or at least stay high for longer.\n\nSuch will be the similarity of the central bank messaging, it might appear co-ordinated. But the extent to which bond markets respond to central banks messaging will be critical.\n\nLast Friday\u2019s strong US jobs data marginally lessened investors\u2019 animal spirits. Central bankers will feel they must do more to contain the markets\u2019 bullish mood and regain control of the inflation narrative.\n\nToday, we get November\u2019s US consumer price inflation data, showing little change and making the journey to 2% seem more difficult.\n\nOn Wednesday, we get US producer price inflation, which will be scrutinised for signs of re-emerging inflationary pressures into 2024.\n\nSimilarly, investors will note US retail sales data on Thursday and China\u2019s industrial production data on Friday for recessionary or deflationary signals.\n\nIn the UK, we get October unemployment data tomorrow and GDP data on Wednesday.\n\nOil prices and the Dollar are firming up, and bond yields have risen in Asian trading overnight. With gold and bitcoin prices falling, the indications are that the liquidity-fuelled pre-Christmas rally is at least pausing for breath.\n\nIt\u2019s a typically quiet Monday with little UK company news.\n\nPrognosticator\n\n\nThis communication is provided for information purposes only, and is not a solicitation or inducement to buy, sell, subscribe, or underwrite securities or units.

In an example of bad news being good news, this would be a positive indicator of lower interest rates next year. As the saying goes, the Fed wants you to lose your job.\n\nHowever, US services ISM/PMI data showed this vital employment sector remains in positive territory, within the 50-55 range of the last few months. And out of the negative, contractionary territory, it briefly visited last year.\n\n\nUK Company News\n\nIn the UK, there is a recommended private equity offer for Ten Entertainment at a 33% premium, valuing the company at GBP287m, continuing the long cycle of the ten-pin bowling industry moving in and out of PE ownership. The premium looks modest and focuses on the potential for a higher offer and the prospects for its larger listed peer, Hollywood Bowl.\n\nLikewise, the floor coverings distributor updated that November 2023 has proved to be a record revenue and profits month. Growth resulted from increased volume rather than price inflation. The company continues to invest in logistics, sales teams, and point of sale to expand its geographical coverage. Its performance reflects good supplier relationships and presence with independent retailers and contractors. It sees further growth in 2024, citing its medium-term ambition of exceeding \u00a3200m in revenue.\n\nLikewise CEO, Tony Brewer is a 40-year flooring veteran and co-founder of Headlam, the UK industry leader. At an age when most people would be spending more time on the golf course, Tony founded Likewise and has grown it at pace to be a national distributor, taking share in a GBP 2bn pa UK market. Flooring retailers require efficient value-added distribution to compete effectively with the major multiples. Tony and his team know how to operate well in the space and seem destined to continue taking market share for some time.\n\nUranium investment company Yellow Cake\u2019s H1 report estimates a proforma NAV of 658p based on a spot price of $81.45 /lb and over 21m lbs of inventory. It continues to expect higher uranium demand as nuclear energy is critical to meeting net-zero ambitions. Notably, China\u2019s nuclear capacity target has increased significantly. On the supply side, Yellow Cake cites its ten-year framework agreement with Kazatomprom, the world\u2019s lowest-cost producer, which allows it to acquire $100 million of uranium annually until 2027, as key to its investment case.\n\nPrognosticator\n\nThis communication is provided for information purposes only, and is not a solicitation or inducement to buy, sell, subscribe, or underwrite securities or units.

The shares, suspended pending restructuring after acquiring various small software and data solutions businesses from Captita earlier this year, will be relisted on AIM from January 10th. In unusual praise of the AIM market, Vin said today that AIM provides a more suitable regulatory environment and greater flexibility for a company of its size. It also announced today that it has already agreed the sale of one of the Capita businesses to Fintel for GBP3.5m.\n\nCML Microsystems, the communications semiconductor supplier, reported H1 results showing 5% revenue growth, 9% PBT growth and a decent cash outturn. It expects the FY to be in line with expectations.\n\nSolid State, the design in component and computing supplier, reported H1 results. Revenue increased by 48%, PBT by 25% and diluted EPS by 7%. It lowered debt with another decent year of cash generation and trades in line with FY expectations.\n\nOxford Metrics reported FY results with revenue ahead by 53% and PBT by 152% and ahead of market forecasts. Its focus on motion capture has driven impressive growth, but it was also positively impacted by the unwinding of prior year component shortages. OM\u2019s revenue is derived from the life science, entertainment, and engineering sectors.\n\nOM is a business undergoing significant transformation. After the sale of Yotta and the transformation of the balance sheet, the new management focus on motion capture looks promising. Its new markerless capture technology can provide growth for OM over the coming years with the added attraction of a more significant software component. Progressive has made its second upgrade to revenue and profits in recent weeks, and based on its forecasts today, OM trades on an ex-cash PE of 11x.

With falling bond yields and a weaker dollar, markets believe the inflation train has left the station, and the next train due is a recession. Regardless of their hawkish tones, investors no longer believe the central banks\u2019 higher-for-longer rhetoric as rate cut expectations are now priced in for H1 2024.\n\nThe longer rates remain at current levels, the greater the recession probability. This concern is reflected in lower oil prices despite a backdrop of increasing Middle East conflict.\n\nHowever, fears of rapidly lower interest rates risk inflation and financial repression. And higher prices for gold and Bitcoin reflect these concerns.\n\nThe Bitcoin price action has become significantly more \u201crisk-off\u201d since the regional banking crisis. The price has now doubled since March and is up 140% YTD.\n\nThis week\u2019s US macroeconomic news includes ISM services data and JOLT job openings tomorrow, followed by nonfarm payrolls on Friday.\n\nWeaker jobs data will further fuel recessionary fears and drive rate expectations lower.

Bond yields and the US dollar both fell further.\n\nChina\u2019s PMI data indicates that its manufacturing sector is still contracting.\n\nOil prices firmed as US data showed falling inventories ahead of the delayed OPEC+ meeting today, where the producer cartel will try to agree production cuts among some of its smaller members.\n\n\nUK Company News\n\nBootmaker Dr Martens said there is an increasingly tricky consumer environment in the US, reporting H1 revenue down 5% and PBT by 55%. It noted widespread macroeconomic caution amongst wholesale customers, which means that FY revenue will decline by more than previously guided, and it is withdrawing previous FY25 revenue guidance. Its debt costs will also be higher.\n\nStruggling high street challenger Metro Bank announced annual cost savings of at least \u00a350m, up from the previous estimate of \u00a330m as it reviews its policies of extended opening hours and seven-day-a-week trading. Its plans involve shedding 20% of its staff. It is also streamlining its Board.\n\nThese moves come days after shareholders approved a capital raise as part of a \u00a3925 million rescue deal where Colombian billionaire Jaime Gilinski now takes a controlling stake.

Expectations are for a flattening out following recently reported declines, raising fears that rates must stay higher for longer.\n\nChina will report on its manufacturing PMI surveys this week, which will be closely watched for indications of the direction of travel for the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nFed chair Powell speaks on Friday.\n\nThe COP-28 Climate Summit opens in Dubai on Thursday as 7,000 delegates fly into the oil-rich nation and spend the next two weeks devising and agreeing on plans to reduce the world\u2019s carbon emissions.\n\nThere is no sign that last year\u2019s COP-27 commitment for Western countries to compensate developing countries for coping with the impact of the green transition has progressed. The pre-event in Berlin this Summer took nine days to reach an agreement on the agenda for this year\u2019s event. Don\u2019t expect much by way of concrete outcomes from Dubai.\n\n\nUK Company News\n\nThings are happening in the listed VC space. Chrysalis has agreed with Jupiter and its managers that they will leave Jupiter to launch a new management entity. Molten Ventures will acquire the smaller VC Forward Partners in an all-share merger and looks to raise an additional \u00a350m via an equity raise.\n\nConcurrent Technologies, the electronic component supplier to the defence sector, now expects to deliver revenue ahead of market expectations and substantially higher than any prior half-year in the company\u2019s history. Order intake has continued growing strongly, giving the Board confidence in material revenue growth this year. The anticipated lifetime value of \u201cmajor design wins\u201d secured in FY23 is estimated to be more than \u00a3100 million. The management has continued to invest in the company\u2019s operational scale to deliver an increasing level of revenue in the coming years. Accordingly, profit in FY23 will align with current market expectations.\n\nConcurrent CEO Miles Adcock has professionalised and upgraded the capabilities of this company in recent years. Despite material supply chain disruptions last year, Concurrent did not lose orders. Today\u2019s update highlights the growing scale and quality of this company\u2019s order book. Its large order intake in 2023 alone is estimated to bring total revenue to the group 4x larger than last year\u2019s total.\n\nPrognosticator\n\nThe Market Call \nEpisode 38\nNovember 27, 2023\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/a0097c6f"

    "description": "UK consumer in better shape\n\n\nMacro & Overnight\n\nUS investors are enjoying their holiday break as the ceasefire in Gaza started with hopes of hostage releases later today.\n\nUK measures of consumer sentiment and spending look better than feared.\n\nAs measured by GfK, UK consumer confidence is improving, albeit bumping along the bottom at -24 for November versus -28 in October.\n\nASDA\u2019s survey of consumer residual \u2018spending\u2019 power (hardly ever mentioned in mainstream media) was up 12% in October, the strongest growth rate over two years \u2013 driven by falling inflation (now 4.6%) and growing real wages (c.7%).\n\nJapan\u2019s inflation rate notched up from 3% to 3.3%, a figure most countries would celebrate, but with negative interest rates, things are different in Japan.\n\nGerman GDP growth has moved from an annualised 0.1% in Q2 to -0.4% in Q3.\n\nOil prices stabilised at lower levels, with the Brent benchmark at $81, as OPEC+ stability is under scrutiny following the cancellation of its weekend meeting. The suggestions are that far from being prepared to share Saudi Arabia\u2019s pain of production cuts, smaller producers, such as Angola and Nigeria, are seeking quota increases. With major oil-consuming economies like Germany slowing down, there is a risk that oil will break down below its established trading range.\n\nSweden has just reported its sixth consecutive month of negative producer prices. For much of Europe, a deflationary recession has overtaken inflation as the main fear.\n\nPrognosticator\n\nThis communication is provided for information purposes only, and is not a solicitation or inducement to buy, sell, subscribe, or underwrite securities or units.

    "description": "Macro & Overnight\n\nThe Open AI Silicon Valley miniseries continued with last night\u2019s episode, which featured the return of previously sacked CEO Sam Altman and a restructured board. The critical difference between Altman and the Board has centred on how quickly to implement new AI products.\n\nThey say the world is speeding up. After Steve Jobs was sacked by the Apple Board in 1985, his reappointment took 11 years. Sam Altman\u2019s return will likely happen within the week.\n\nWho knows what twists and turns this gripping soap opera still has in store? But Satya Nadella clarified that things only happen at Open AI with Microsoft\u2019s consent. One commentator dryly noted, \u201cThere is nothing as safe as artificial general intelligence without computing power.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, elsewhere in the Valley, AI hardware winner Nvidia released strong results within guidance. However, the share price had expected more and fell after hours, indicating that the US market is somewhat overbought.\n\n\nUK Company News\n\nIt\u2019s a busier day of results in the UK today amid encouraging signs of increasing capital market activity.\n\nAggregates supplier SigmaRoc will acquire US-listed CRH\u2019s European limestone businesses, and CRH will become a significant shareholder. The deal involves a \u00a3200m share placing today.\n\nThe smaller UK companies sector has seen several \u00a3100m -plus equity raises this week, including from Sirius Real Estate and Videndum. Together, these deals total over \u00a3500m \u2013 not bad for three days\u2019 work.\n\nIt is good to see the UK stock market fulfilling its principal function of raising capital for companies rather than just serving as a means for companies to retire their equity.\n\nPrognosticator\n\nThe Market Call \nEpisode 35\nNovember 22, 2023\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/99fa10f6"

    "description": "While today's financial news coverage focused on the Autumn Statement, probably the most significant economic news yesterday was the postponement of the OPEC+ meeting this weekend. With signs of fracturing within the cartel, this casts doubt on its ability to implement production cuts. In a demonstration of the fragility in the world's most critical and rigged energy market, benchmark oil prices fell over 5% on the news, albeit they recovered later.\nThe recent decline in global energy prices went unnoticed by the UK's OFGEM energy regulator, which announced that the UK retail energy price cap would rise by 5% in the new year.\nAs the US takes its Thanksgiving holiday, the UK is busy absorbing yesterday's Autumn Statement. As usual, the Chancellor pulled fewer rabbits from his hat than the build-up suggested. The political theatre attached to this event ramps up as election year approaches.\nIn summary, the giveaways, such as NI reductions and increased investment allowances, were less than the inflationary-fueled fiscal drag on tax revenues. Hence, the UK will still have its highest tax take as a proportion of GDP since World War Two.\nHowever, it is worth noting that the UK's GDP is a full 2%age points higher than that forecasted by the OBR only six months ago.\nThere were no new measures to address the functioning of the UK's capital markets. And the only direct action for stock market investors was a plan to revive the If You See Sid campaign to widen share ownership and sell off the Exchequers' remaining holding in Nat West Bank to retail investors. This holding in Nat West is a hangover from the Global Financial Crisis, which the government has struggled to offload to institutional investors for the last 14 years. It was recently embroiled in the \"debanking\" scandal that cost it its CEO. Perhaps the campaign should be renamed If You See Nigel, Please Don't Tell Him.\nMotorpoint Retail, the used car supermarket, reported significant H1 revenue and profit declines, driven by lower volumes and a fall in finance commissions. It also suffered an increase in finance expenses during the period. More recently, it has seen reduced wholesale used car prices of about 6% in just the last six weeks, more deflationary signals.\nPrognosticator\n\nThe Market Call \nEpisode 36\nNovember 23, 2023\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/389dbe81"

    "description": "Telecom Plus dials back to pre-2014\n\nThere is little new to report on the macro front. The rally in risk assets continued yesterday and overnight.\nUK investors await tomorrow's Autumn Statement; the \u00a3 has strengthened to 1.25 against a weakening dollar.\nThe Open AI saga is moving into a full-scale corporate meltdown, with 95% of its staff indicating no confidence in the Board and a preference to join their former bosses at Microsoft.\nThe decision to sack Altman last week has probably cost the ethically-minded Board about $85 billion value.\nTelecom Plus, which trades as Utility Warehouse, reported H1 Revenue up 57% and profit up 36%. The critical customer count is up +14% to 950,000, the 5th consecutive half-year period delivering double-digit customer growth. It says the energy market looks similar to the competitive landscape before 2014 when six large suppliers held over 90% market share. It further states that its ability to offer hard-pressed people a meaningful second income for recommending its multiservice customer proposition to people they know supports strong customer growth. With just a 3% market share, the growth opportunity remains significant: it can double the size of the business yet remain only the 7th largest supplier in the UK.\nTelecom Plus has a unique customer proposition whose competitive advantage was negated after 2014 when OFGEM began offering incentives to new alternative energy providers. With the sharp rise in energy costs in 2021 putting most smaller entrants out of business, Telecom Plus's cost advantage has returned, enabling it to double its customer base. Today, it looks forward to doubling it again. Telecom Plus's outlook seems well grounded with its ability to cross-sell a multiservice offering to its growing list of new customers.\nPrognosticator\n\nThe Market Call \nEpisode 34\nNovember 21, 2023\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/675a731b"

Ian discussed the geo-spatial theme linking two of our stocks, Idox and Oxford Metrics, who reported recently. Both companies are on the acquisition trail and Ian and George pondered whether the more realistic prices seen lately would bring a flow of companies back from private equity and venture capital markets into the public market.\nThe pair looked at the similarities and differences between the customers and backers of Cisco and NVIDIA and the tendency for tech investors to buy into a trend rather than the business case when there are so many tech stocks and ecosystems to consider. Lastly they talked about the 10x over-subscribed Raspberry Pi IPO and questioned the price discovery process following the 43% hike in share price.\nCompanies mentioned include:\nIdox, Oxford Metrics, Tracsis, RWS, NVIDIA, Cisco, Meta, Google, Microsoft, Wintel, NetScientific and Raspberry Pi.\n\nIf you enjoyed listening to the Talking Tech podcast you might like to take a look at the accompanying Talking Tech insights ( https://progressive-research.com/insights/category/sector-insights-and-podcasts-from-progressives-tech-team/ ).\n\nBrought to you by Progressive ( https://progressive-research.com/ ).\n\nTalking Tech\nEpisode 4\nJune 18, 2024\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/7eac2806"

Jeremy quotes a chancellor to Louis XIV, and suggests that Rachel Reeves will do well to produce a budget that \"plucks the goose\" enough to produce plenty of feathers, but doesn't bring too much hissing. If she does that, markets could rebound strongly. Despite all the headwinds, the UK market is still showing signs of life...deals from (or for) THG, CAB Payments, Sainsbury's Qatari investors and Tritax Eurobox all suggest that activity is beginning to rebuild, although investment groups are still seeing outflows, and company managements are selling shares, probably in advance of the Budget.

Ironically, current tensions in the Middle East might be helping markets ignore Japan for a while longer, but in Europe inflation has fallen fast, raising concerns of a slowing economic outlook. In the UK, as well as a buoyant housing market, we have a suddenly-active set of equity markets, with plenty of deals, fundraisings and another IPO all on the radar.

The main macro surprise this week has been some rapid and arguably extreme stimulus activities undertaken by the Chinese authorities...Jeremy points out that although this has been seen as something of a \"sugar rush\" of good news (Chinese equities rose by almost 4%) there may be a deeper concern over what the Chinese are seeing that requires such a major set of measures. Commodities responded well to the anticipated boost to China's economy - except oil, which has been weak and where the Saudi abandonment of a $100 per barrel target could lead to further price declines. In the UK, the Labour government is under orders to \"cheer up\" and the OECD is helpful with accepting more-lax borrowing rules to fund the Green Transition. Hopefully the bad news has been delivered up-front, and the Budget at the end of October may be less painful than we've been led to believed. Alastair describes some recent caution he's seen in past weeks and months, with housing markets reflecting some of the doom-mongering talk, as confidence has perhaps ebbed, despite reducing rates. An unusually strong summer has been followed by a muted start to the usually-stronger autumn. ISG, a major contractor in the industry has collapsed into administration, with risk that Government projects especially in prisons and schools may be impacted. Exposure to bad debts so far seems contained (as many saw this coming) but could turn into a fast-breeder issue if other contractors are brought down. UK company news has seen a flurry of reporting - Progressive clients ZOO Digital ( https://progressive-research.com/research/agm-update-shows-continuing-recovery/ ), Van Elle ( https://progressive-research.com/research/outlook-confirmed-as-order-book-expands/ ), IG Design Group ( https://progressive-research.com/research/persisting-us-trends-hold-back-performance/ ), Tern ( https://progressive-research.com/research/financial-flexibility-reinstated/ )and Oxford Metrics ( https://progressive-research.com/research/after-h1-strength-h2-slows/ ) all with updates, and initiation of coverage on a new client, Nexus Infrastructure ( https://progressive-research.com/research/engineered-to-lead-housebuilding-revival/ ). Exposure to overseas markets (especially the USA) is proving problematic with a number of economies potentially slowing. There are also risks of disappointment as strong Sterling means companies translate overseas profits into less-favourable exchange rates for UK investors.\n\nNext week sees more news from China with some PMI data which might drive sentiment, especially given this week's stimulus news. We also have inflation data from the EU, but the main event might be USA payroll figures, with a weak expectation (130k vs last month's 142k)...if the number is weaker than that, expectations on US interest rates might decline which could provide a boost to equities.\n----------------- Brought to you by Progressive Equity ( https://progressive-research.com/ )\n\nThe Market Call \nEpisode 91\nSeptember 27, 2024\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/37fc0b85"

    "description": "This week, Jeremy ( https://progressive-research.com/people/jeremy-mckeown/ ) and Gareth ( https://progressive-research.com/people/gareth-evans/ ) discuss the prospects for a soft or hard landing for the US economy. While bond and oil markets are pricing in a recession, other markets like gold and the yen suggest financial market stress. However, while the US inflation prints are softening, the main focus for policymakers is jobs. Equity markets are skittish and indecisive, with the AI bubble coming and going, as measured by a volatile Nvidia price, which ended up 15% over the week. On the other hand, concerns about their economic sensitivity hold back flows into value and smaller cap companies.\n\nThe economic data in the UK have not been great, but they are OK. GDP is flat for the second consecutive month, and employment data is mixed.\n\nAshanti's agreed \u00a32bn offer for Centamin this week highlights the huge disparity between the price of gold and the valuation of gold miners. Evidently, the cheapest way to acquire gold reserves is via M&A rather than digging.\n\nGareth discusses Gamma Communication's ( https://progressive-research.com/research/strong-results-with-clear-direction/ ) positive financial results and its development of valuable relationships with Microsoft and Cisco. Given its growing ambition, Gamma plans to move from AIM to the main market.\n\nJeremy highlights news this week from Alpha Group ( https://www.alphagroup.com/ ), where founder and CEO Morgan Tillbrook ( https://www.alphagroup.com/person/morgan-tillbrook/?group=98#/about/#post-945 ) announced plans to step aside in favour of Non-Executive Chairman Clive Kahn ( https://www.alphagroup.com/person/clive-kahn/?group=98#/about/#post-1064 ). Alpha shares weakened as Clive is not well known in public markets. However, his strong track record in the global payments and FX world with Travelex and World Pay, among others, makes him a strong candidate to take Alpha Group to the next level.\n\nNext week, we could see a re-run of August's yen carry trade volatility with the US rate decision followed by Japan's inflation data and the BoJ's rate decision the following morning. The consequences of an unexpectedly high ( 3%) Japanese CPI print could set things off again.\n\nThe Market Call \nEpisode 89\nSeptember 13, 2024\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/bfd4e843"

But there is risk - Jeremy highlights that the last time the Fed cut rates by 0.5% in one go was (coincidentally also September 18th) back in 2007...at that time, perhaps the Fed knew some things that the rest of us didn't, but either way, the following 15 months saw the S&P halved in value under what we now know as the Global Financial Crisis. This time, we're all hoping it is different. All perhaps except Donald Trump who is saying that the Fed must think the US economy is in very bad shape... UK inflation was static this week at 2.2%, and rates were held steady. UK markets saw a flood of corporate reporting, which was generally on-track with expectations. Progressive had four clients with news - Springfield Properties ( https://progressive-research.com/research/debt-reduction-strategy-pays-dividends/ ) (Scottish housebuilder) saw debt reducing and returned to paying a dividend, alongside an extension of our forecasts by another two years. Printhead specialist Xaar ( https://progressive-research.com/research/transition-gathers-pace/ )delivered a solid and in-line H1, with material opportunities in markets not traditionally associated with printing (coatings for EV batteries, and jewelry molds) although they are still reliant on some more-traditional product launches by customers to help deliver the second half of the year. DP Poland ( https://progressive-research.com/company/dp-poland-plc/ ) reported that its Domino's Pizza businesses in Poland and Croatia performed very well across their H1, with more store openings planned, happy customers and early signs that they are attracting franchisees, whose efforts and capital could further accelerate performance and improve returns. Finally, Mongolian oil & gas explorer Petro Matad ( https://progressive-research.com/research/interims-and-heron-update/ ) may no longer be an \"explorer\"...their plans to move to production at the Heron field took a step closer, with a deal close to finalisation allowing product (due to begin flowing in October) to be transported, stored and then sold through a neighbouring oilfield. Returning to the theme of a possibly-slowing US economy, UK investors were reminded of the risks by TT Electronics...their warning seemed to be operational rather than economy-induced, but clearly signals that all is not always gold across the Atlantic. Keep an eye on FX translation of US profits to Sterling - the dollar has been weakening for some time. Next week looks quiet, with inflation and interest rates data from Japan (spoiler alert - post our recording, at 2.8% inflation was as expected, and rates were held) and US Core PCE inflation due next Friday.\n\nThe Market Call \nEpisode 90\nSeptember 22, 2024\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/e3c5ec47"

This time, the worry is that although Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has told us that the main worry is no longer inflation, near-term economic data need to land in a very small \"Goldilocks zone\". Too strong (hot) and the economy might stoke the fires of inflation, preventing the rate cuts Jay Powell has pretty much promised; too weak and the economy is cooling fast, potentially falling towards recession territory and jeopardising the soft landing that markets have pretty much promised themselves. Markets seem worried about this too...Japanese equities have tumbled 4%, and NVIDIA has lost almost half a trillion dollars in value, in just over a week. Relative to these global concerns, UK plc is trading quite well, even if the UK retail investor is fretting about potentially-rising taxes (especially on Capital Gains) in the October budget.\n\nCompany news includes a decent trading update from Vertu ( https://progressive-research.com/research/robust-market-progress/ ), strong H1 results from STV ( https://progressive-research.com/research/strong-h1-growth-solid-outlook-new-ceo/ )and Concurrent Technologies ( https://progressive-research.com/podcasts/concurrent-technologies-ceo-miles-adcock-talks-with-myself-and-jeremy-mckeown/ ), and an interesting announcement from ASOS, including some positive uses of AI to improve operational metrics and profitability. By the time this podcast is aired, we will know the US jobs data from Friday - [spoiler alert...Jeremy was right - the number was weak, missed the Goldilocks level, and markets fell].

Markets have had a few days to digest the comments from US Fed Chairman Jay Powell, who last week steered towards lower US rates at the Jackson Hole gathering of central bankers. The fear might have been that this could prompt new worries over the US-Japan carry trade, but so far, both debt and equity markets have been stable...essentially saying \"OK, we were expecting this....now please deliver the soft landing with lower rates and stable, low inflation\". The US dollar continues to slowly weaken, useful for most non-US nations. The big corporate news of the week was the much-awaited Q2 results for NVIDIA - a doubling of revenue to $30bn (!), uplift to next-quarter guidance and a $50bn (!) share buyback all looked good, but weren't enough to stop the shares tumbling 7%. We discuss whether this means a cooling of appetite for the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech titans, or investor concern over the wall of spending - much of which is the others in the Mag Seven buying chips from NVIDIA...we ask whether investor worry over what could be a \"winner takes all\" game could bring more scrutiny on future investments. One bright side from this shift in attitude might be that smaller (and non-US) stocks could get more attention from big investors - and once again, the UK would be very well placed to benefit. Next week is mainly about jobs - some big US jobs data points which, although volatile and hard to predict, will hopefully show that the US economy is robust but not overheating...anything other than that would make it tricky for Jay Powell to engineer the much-anticipated soft landing.

Producer prices are showing some signs of increase at the output side, and there were slightly higher levels of inflation in terms of inputs which suggests that companies are swallowing some of the price increases. This can\u2019t last forever, so there are a couple of warning bells longer-term for the inflation outlook.\n\nNevertheless, the outlook for the UK economy seems solid, and the UK markets are seeing good levels of interest from global investors. It might not feel like we\u2019re off to the races, but at least our markets survived the recent volatility relatively unscathed when compared to other major financial centres.\n\nSterling remains strong, and the US dollar is gradually weakening\u2026strange with global risks rising in both the Middle East and Europe, and potentially a sign of pressure from the central bankers. We\u2019ll learn a lot more from the Jackson Hole meeting of those central bankers in the next week \u2013 most of all regarding rate outlooks for the USA and Japan, affecting the all-important but hard-to-quantify Yen Carry Trade, for which a small wobble rocked markets dramatically over the past fortnight.\nUK company news saw regulatory approval for a major deal at Beeks ( https://progressive-research.com/company/beeks-financial-cloud-group-plc/ ), a reassuring update from CML Microsystems ( https://progressive-research.com/company/cml-microsystems-plc/ ), but a major warning from Accesso Technology, who are seeing weak levels of customer visits at the visitor attractions/theme parks they serve.\n\nNext week we have FOMC minutes in the USA, and Japanese inflation data which could re-focus people on the carry trade if the figure is out of line with the 2.9% expectation.

    "description": "This week has seen a flurry of macro data, giving Jeremy ( https://progressive-research.com/people/jeremy-mckeown/ )and Gareth ( https://progressive-research.com/people/gareth-evans/ )plenty to discuss. European growth is slowing (the German economy is in decline) but inflation is nudging upwards - not a good combination. Elsewhere, we saw one rate rise, one rate reduction and a \"wait and see\". Japan saw rates rise, just as US rates were signposted likely to be reduced in future months (possibly September) - this could lead to significant volatility - the Yen has soared and Japanese stocks plummeted (6%). The reduction in the UK was partly expected, but clearly good news - and markets price in another 1% or even 1.5% of reductions in the coming quarters.\n\nUS market volatility continues, with Nvidia yo-yoing in a way that a mega-cap stock perhaps should not - all on the back of confusion over AI spend and adoption. But the bigger US (and global) issue is the \"freight train\" of debt - and Jeremy explains that some sneaky short-term arrangements being used in the US could lead to a major and dangerous combination of refinancing needed just as the Federal debt ceiling is being renegotiated very early in 2025 - tricky at the best of times, but if the US election is still being contested, the outcome could be severe indeed. Closer to home, Progressive stocks with news included Van Elle ( https://progressive-research.com/research/first-in-line-for-housing-and-infrastructure-boost/ ), Xaar ( https://progressive-research.com/research/h1-trading-update-in-line-reassurance/ ), Severfield ( https://progressive-research.com/research/strong-start-to-year-highlighted-in-upbeat-agm/ ), Forterra ( https://progressive-research.com/research/h1-results-in-line-but-caution-on-h2-outlook/ )and Watkin Jones ( https://progressive-research.com/research/innovative-jv-deal-reinforces-project-pipeline/ ) - with the \"light at the end of the tunnel\" sentiment common to these groups also echoed by FDM Group. Rathbone is seeing more-positive investor sentiment. Next week there's US PMI data due, as well as some trade and inflation figures to come from China. Other than that, we're expecting a fairly quiet week.\nMade possible byProgressive Equity ( https://progressive-research.com/ ).\n\nThe Market Call \nEpisode 83\nAugust 2, 2024\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/0076e98c"

    "description": "This week Jeremy and Gareth discuss what was supposed to be a quiet week but was anything but.\n\nThe US unemployment rate of last Friday triggered the Sahm Rule, indicating that the US is in recession.\n\nThis was the spark that lit markets and, in particular, uncovered concerns about the global Yen debt levels and the popular Yen carry trade. US tech stocks and Japanese equities fell sharply. This came on top of a few weeks in which oil, copper prices and the dollar had all weakened.\n\nMarkets stabilised during the week, but markets remain nervous.\n\nThe questions now being asked are what is the extent of the carry trade, and what can be done about it?\n\nThe policy response will be the main concern of the Fed's summer recess in Jackson Hole later this month.\n\nSo far, at least, the UK is largely looking on as an observer, not in the eye of the storm.\n\nIn the UK, things continue, and companies continue to broadly deliver against expectations.\n\nThey discuss Sanderson Design ( https://progressive-research.com/research/stronger-july-trading-to-end-h1-driven-by-north-america/ ) #SDG ( https://sandersondesign.group/ ) update and its prospects with lower rates expected along with the wider housing and housing-related markets.\n\nNext week, we get inflation prints from the UK and the US and the flash print of the UK's Q2 GDP y/y growth rate which should be approaching 1%.\n\nBrought to you byProgressive Equity ( https://progressive-research.com/ )\n\nThe Market Call \nEpisode 84\nAugust 9, 2024\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/f131fd5b"

    "description": "Gareth ( https://progressive-research.com/people/gareth-evans/ )and Jeremy ( https://progressive-research.com/people/jeremy-mckeown/ )are joined this week by Ian Robertson ( https://progressive-research.com/people/ian-robertson/ ) to bring a \"tech perspective\" given the tumble in US mega-cap tech stocks. Markets reacted in a cautious way to Biden's decision to step aside in favour of Kamala Harris, and there are some signs that global economies remain fragile. We also had warnings and downgrades from a number of bellwether stocks - notably Unilever and Nestle, as well as UPS and a slew of automotive players. But a big theme this week has been a retracement from Tesla and Alphabet whose AI investments seem to be concerning their investors, with consequent extrapolation to Nvidia and its \"entourage\".  Ian reprises his recent blog on AI ( https://progressive-research.com/insights/nvidia-and-cisco-history-rhymes-commentators-repeat/ ) - with his view that \"this time it's different\"...we're not in a Cisco-style collapse from the early-2000s. Telco spend in the late 1990s was arguably unsustainable and all chasing the same customer wallets...this time around, the cash is plentiful, the expected use cases are many and varied, and hopefully investors' expectations are being managed. Big Tech is spending vast sums on AI - and mainly Nvidia hardware to run it. Some of them will get it wrong, but probably not all...and there could be a crop of newly-emerging players we've never heard of yet, but who come through with killer AI applications to dominate new industries. Next week's reporting from Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Apple should tell us a bit more about how the big players are finding things... To hear more from our tech team on this and other tech news, read the latest Talking Tech Insights ( https://progressive-research.com/insights/category/sector-insights-and-podcasts-from-progressives-tech-team/ ) or listen to their podcasts ( https://progressive-research.com/series/talking-tech/ ). The Trump \"rotation trade\" started off as a risk-on psychology pushing traders to \"bank\" their gains in the mega-cap tech names and hunt (or forage) for better returns in smaller stocks and (even) international markets such as the UK. Sadly, this is now morphing into more of a risk-off attitude, with nervousness around a number of asset classes. Within this, the UK economy appears more resilient than a struggling Europe and what seems to be a slowing USA. Progressive client commentary centred on Beeks Financial Cloud ( https://progressive-research.com/company/beeks-financial-cloud-group-plc/ ) and STV Group ( https://progressive-research.com/company/stv-group-plc/ ), both of which delivered positive news and signs of strong growth in both cases. Next week sees a flurry of data - notably the UK interest rate decision (potentially a 25bp cut, but nothing guaranteed), European GDP growth and US jobs data as well as a hopefully-unexciting US Fed rate decision. Jeremy has for some time been highlighting the challenges facing Japan - any shock moves next week (they have an interest rate decision due) could have ramifications greater than you might think...

And having witnessed a decade or more of US dollar dominance and outperforming developed markets, particularly US markets, why bother looking at the rest of the world? After all, isn\u2019t that where all the bad stuff happens, like currency crises and debt defaults?\n\nRecently, there have been signs that Emerging Markets might be re-emerging. This year, there have been signs that the dollar\u2019s dominance may not be quite so dominant. Following the Fed\u2019s decision to cut rates by 50 basis points, China announced an intention to add significant heft to its policy of loosening monetary and fiscal conditions in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nFollowing an extended period of being considered uninvestable, Chinese equities had a near 30% bounce in a couple of weeks. Was this just some hasty short closing or a re-awakening of the biggest emerging markets? This is currently one of the fiercest debates among global investors.\n\nI wanted to get the perspective of an emerging markets expert, so I was delighted to have the chance to speak with Leila Kardouche of Variis Partners. Leila is a veteran of the space, and she and her small team recently launched a new London-based emerging markets partnership, filling a space left by several high-profile investors who have recently left this area due to its long period of disappointing returns.\n\nIn this episode, we learn about the structure of Emerging Markets and how benchmark indices such as the MSCI are not very helpful in uncovering the full potential of the growth opportunities often obscured within these markets. Among other things, Leila discusses how to evaluate political risk in this widely diverse range of markets as we take a tour of what\u2019s hot and what\u2019s not in an investment universe covering 85% of the world\u2019s population.\n\nCritically, Leila and the Variis team focus on stock selection. Leila discusses how the challenges of growing businesses in emerging markets have produced some very successful compounding growth opportunities. Yes, these companies have outperformed strongly even within markets like China, which has been disappointing overall.\n\nBe sure you are subscribed to In The Company of Mavericks on your podcast app to avoid missing the next and future episodes.\n\nMade possible by Progressive Equity ( https://progressive-research.com/ ).\n\nIn the Company of Mavericks \nEpisode 54\nOctober 21, 2024\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/812579f0\n\n\u2605 Additional episodes: http://www.inthecompanyofmavericks.com"

Not only were we impressed with Sweet Stocks\u2019 quality, but the weekly publication cadence also meant it was the work of a highly experienced and disciplined analyst.\n\nA few weeks later, we chatted with Alex Sweet ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-sweet-cfa/ ), the man behind the Substack, about what motivates his work, his investment philosophy, his analytical rigour, and, crucially, some of his UK stock ideas.\n\nAlex didn\u2019t disappoint. He gave a masterclass on investing in quality compounding companies capable of \u201cbeating the fade\u201d and on how he uses his fundamental analytical approach to find these anomalous gems globally.\n\nThis episode teaches how Adam and Alex use similar, in-depth fundamental frameworks to derive different strategies. Adam focuses on contrarian deep value, while Alex focuses on growth at a reasonable price.\n\nThese two investors illustrate the type of discipline involved in professional investment analysis. They also share an interest in the crazy world of Ultrarunning. Alex talks about his newfound passion for the Backyard Ultra, an offshoot of the Barkley Marathons, an event he hopes to run 300 miles in three days later this year.\n\nThe stocks we cover in this episode are 4imprint ( https://investors.4imprint.com/investors/ ), YouGov ( https://corporate.yougov.com/investors/ ) and Loungers ( https://loungers.co.uk/about/ ).\n\nI must just tell you that the people on this podcast might own shares in the companies mentioned, but nothing you are about to hear is investment advice. The opinions expressed are purely the contributors' personal views and do not represent the views of Progressive Equity or any other organisation mentioned in this podcast. I hope you find this content informative and entertaining. I learned a lot, but please take professional financial advice before investing a penny in these crazy markets.\n\nI also wrote a Substack article about this podcast at HyperNormalTimes ( https://progressive-research.com/podcasts/market-capitulations-narrative-shifts-with-adam-rackley-of-cape-wrath-capital/ ).\n\nMade possible by Progressive Equity ( https://progressive-research.com/ ).\n\nIn the Company of Mavericks \nEpisode 53\nOctober 3, 2024\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/fb6646ed\n\n\u2605 Additional episodes: http://www.inthecompanyofmavericks.com"

However, he thinks investors are over their skis regarding US equities, specifically the Mag Seven.\n\nHe is more positive about UK equities and describes why the consensual view that Chinese equities are uninvestable draws him to them.\n\nAs he says, we are all invested in China already, but at several times the value of most Chinese stocks.\n\nAs always, nothing you hear in this podcast is investment advice, and all the views expressed by the contributors are in a personal capacity only and do not represent the views of Progressive Equity or any other organization mentioned in this podcast.\n\nPlease enjoy my conversation with the maverick, Duncan MacInnes.\n\nMade possible byProgressive Equity ( https://progressive-research.com/ ).\n\nIn the Company of Mavericks \nEpisode 50\nSeptember 20, 2024\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/7f88cd5d\n\n\u2605 Additional episodes: http://www.inthecompanyofmavericks.com"

Having survived a near-death experience while serving in the Israeli Navy in 2006, he has established Windward as a high-growth, recurring revenue company with a large addressable market. Ami is one of life\u2019s optimists and a joy to chat with.\nIn this episode, he discusses the challenges of running an unprofitable growth company, how being told \"NO\" is only temporary, the importance of building resilience, and why listing in London has been such a positive move for him and the business.\nIt was great having Mark\u2019s experienced approach to guide Ami through the key pillars of Windward\u2019s investment case and paint a picture of what Windward could become as it approaches profitability and reinvests in its rapidly growing platform.\nI must remind you that this is for information purposes only.

It has been closed to new investors for most of its life, and a significant proportion of the fund is owned by its portfolio managers, including Geoff.\nI was fortunate enough to invest in the Ennismore European Smaller Companies fund on its launch.

Remarkably over the period, the fund only had three down years: 2008, 2009, and 2020, which together represented an aggregate negative 12% return.

After a 10-year break, Geoff came back into portfolio management in an effort to help turn around the Ennismore Global Fund.

He talks about mistakes he made in the GFC and how providing liquidity to investors is a good discipline despite investing in an illiquid asset class. He also describes how he defines quality companies and how they should be valued, but he also talks about how he always looks for a margin of safety.

I subscribe to a lot of podcasts, but there aren\u2019t many that I always listen to. However, Uncle Jim\u2019s World of Bonds is always a must-listen to. It's both entertaining and informative. It is typically just 10 minutes long and contains some real nuggets covering macroeconomics, financial markets, politics, and the long-term drivers impacting the world all investors inhabit. We recorded this chat on July 1st, and quite a lot has happened since then. Obviously, we have had elections in the UK and France and the advancement of England and France to the semifinals of Euro 24.  In this episode, Jim discusses why he thinks bonds are so interesting and important and what we, as investors, can learn from them. He also discusses Trussonomics, the implications of French political instability, the potential impact of an unwinding of Japan\u2019s carry trade, what to know about credit spreads, and how they might inform equity markets. Jim has been a fund manager at M&G ( https://bondvigilantes.com/ ) for 27 years, most recently as CIO for fixed income. Since we recorded this episode, Jim has announced his departure later this year to study art history. I very much hope he can also find the time to keep up his podcasting, maybe interspersing yield curve analysis with a view on the modern relevance of German expressionism from the inter-war period.  I must remind you that none of what you hear is investment advice, it is all just the personal views of the people talking and does not represent the views of any organisation mentioned in this podcast. Please enjoy my conversation with Uncle Jim about his world of bonds.\n\nMade possible by Progressive Equity.\n\nIn the Company of Mavericks \nEpisode 43\nJuly 9, 2024\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/85e7f19e\n\n\u2605 Additional episodes: http://www.inthecompanyofmavericks.com"

    "description": "In this episode, Julian Collett of Blackdown Partners ( https://blackdown.com/ ) joins me for a conversation with Simon Philips, the founder and CEO of CT Automotive ( https://ct-automotive.net/investors/#board-of-directors ), a \u00a350m market cap, AIM-listed company.\nSimon\u2019s journey is a powerful example of how adverse circumstances, can be a fertile ground for learning and growth. His story underscores the crucial role of resilience in business success. The development of a business supplying tooling and components to the global automotive industry is a testament to Simon\u2019s well-honed entrepreneurial skills and can-do attitude, forged in the face of adversity.\nGrowing up in one of London\u2019s more socially deprived areas, Simon thrived in maths, physics, and engineering but was thwarted by his dyslexia in pursuing conventional employment. Through successful side hustles developed during his university years, Simon bought into a plastics moulding and tool-making business, becoming MD of his own company at the age of 25.\nSimon's vision for CT Automotive was clear from the start. He saw the huge potential in manufacturing in China to Western standards. This foresight led him to spend 16 years living in China, transforming CT from its tool-making roots into a global component supply business that serves most of the world\u2019s largest automotive OEMs.\nSimon candidly discusses the challenges he faced in his chosen career path and how he overcame them. He shares why he chose to IPO the business on AIM in 2021 and reflects on the following couple of years as the most challenging period he has ever experienced.\nLooking forward, Simon talks about the need to stay ahead via the adoption of AI and robotics, a trend that is happening so quickly that the shape of the automotive industry he supplies will be unknowable over the next few years. However, as he says, CT went to China for its low costs but is staying because of its world-class leadership in modern manufacturing technology.\nThis is a fascinating story of resilience, innovation and raw entrepreneurialism.\nPlease enjoy our conversation with the maverick, Simon Philips.\nMade possible by Progressive Equity ( https://progressive-research.com/ ).\n\nIn the Company of Mavericks \nEpisode 42\nJuly 3, 2024\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/dc2b224d\n\n\u2605 Additional episodes: http://www.inthecompanyofmavericks.com"

He wants a band of loyal investors who understand and back his strategy, a strategy he is fully committed to and invested in.\nWhile he has all the credentials of a conventional equity fund manager, Adam is anything but.

A few years later Nick became CEO.\n\nAlvis was eventually acquired by BAe, and Nick, along with several former Alvis colleagues, set up Cohort in 2006. With a market value of \u00a326m, Cohort aims to provide technical services to the defence industry in the UK and abroad.\n\nToday, 18 years later, Cohort is the parent company of six operating businesses, providing a wide range of services and products for British and international customers in defence, security, and related markets. Its market capitalisation is \u00a3335m.\n\nIn a fascinating discussion, Nick talks about the changing nature of the defence industry over his long career, why he decided to establish Cohort, how he has gone about making acquisitions and the decentralised operating model for the Group, how the listed defence industry has changed, and how our rapidly changing geopolitics is likely to change the operating environment for Cohort in the coming years.\n\nWith defence spending rising up the priority list for all Western countries, the outlook for Cohort and the rest of the defence industry hasn\u2019t looked this good for decades. As he says the expansion of the Chinese navy over the last 20 years is a source of considerable concern to other countries in the region, such as Australia, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines, all of which are Cohort customers. Meanwhile, the war in Ukraine has radically changed perceptions about the need to fund defence budgets further in Europe.\n\nI began by asking Nick about his background and how and why he came to establish Cohort in 2006.\n\nMade possible by Progressive Equity Research.

I have a personal investment in Onward. Dowgate Group owns 9.26% of Transense Technologies PLC, of which Onward Opportunities owns 6.96%.\n\nLast year, Onward's fund manager, Laurence Hulse ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurence-hulse-a86a972b/ ), proposed an investment in Transense Technologies ( https://www.transense.com/ ). My initial reaction could best be described as having a Victor Meldrew moment. Those with stock market memories may recall that Transense has a history of failing to meet its ambitious plans and targets and repeatedly returned to investors to back its innovative sensor technology.\n\nIn 2007, Transense had a market cap of \u00a360m and forecast revenue of \u00a3300,000. Its exciting disruptive technology, Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW), was destined to achieve widespread adoption in the automotive industry. However, this didn't happen, and instead, Transense developed a well-earned reputation for serial stock market underachievement.\n\nAs Sir John Templeton said, the four most dangerous words in investing are, This Time It's Different. With these words in mind, on today's episode, I am joined by Laurence to hear how Executive Chairman Nigel Rogers ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigel-rogers-79b4601/ ) and Managing Director Ryan Maughan ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-maughan-a2893610/ ) have repositioned this failed AIM-listed, blue-sky growth stock of the early 2000s. It is a fascinating case study of how UK-listed microcap companies can become forgotten and ignored as recovery strategies are implemented and latent value is created. As Nigel mentions, the AIM market is far from perfect.\n\nToday, Transense has a market cap of just \u00a315m and is only now beginning to exploit SAW's true potential in areas like motorsport, EVs, aerospace and robotics. Following an innovative licensing deal with tyre giant Bridgestone that has effectively underwritten the business's foreseeable future, Transense today is led by a combination of Nigel's experienced financial nouse and Ryan's proven engineering credentials and entrepreneurial instincts.\n\nIn this episode, we learn how Transense Technologies has been right-sized and can face the future on a firm financial footing, giving it time to exploit opportunities in SAW and its tyre-measuring device business, Translogik.\n\nPlease enjoy our conversation with Nigel and Ryan of Transense Technologies and why this time, it's different.\n\nBrought to you by Progressive Equity Research ( https://progressive-research.com/ ).\n\nIn the Company of Mavericks \nEpisode 35\nMay 2, 2024\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/3ca00c03\n\n\u2605 Additional episodes: http://www.inthecompanyofmavericks.com"

Scott talks about market performance in Q1 2024. Where have markets come from, how have they performed in Q1, and where are they going? Bond yields have risen, inflation is sticky, and rates are higher for longer. Equities have had a good quarter, albeit the Magnificent Seven have not been quite so magnificent. The UK, by comparison, has been lacklustre. Gold has been the Q1 showstopper, and the main buyer seems to have been China's central bank, the POBC. Are they about to devalue the Red Cabbage or launch a military campaign?\n\nIn Q1, small caps underperformed large caps in Q1 in UK and US. The UK IPO market remains moribund. There have been more deaths than births in the UK market YTD. Is the UK stock market just a dumpster fire, or can it recover? Gareth is hopeful for a recovery.\n\nJeremy highlights the Middle East conflict, its limited impact on financial markets, and what to look for going forward. The big news is UK inflation, but he remains sceptical that the UK will cut rates ahead of the Fed.\n\nGareth discusses the week's company news, highlighting the Severfield ( https://progressive-research.com/research/step-change-in-european-and-indian-outlook/ ) results with a strong order book and a share buyback.\n\nIn next week's news, Jeremy highlights US PCE inflation data and the Bank of Japan's interest rate decision.\n\nMade possible by Progressive Equity ( https://progressive-research.com/ ).\n\nIn the Company of Mavericks \nEpisode 33\nApril 20, 2024\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/620afb2a\n\n\u2605 Additional episodes: http://www.inthecompanyofmavericks.com"

He has been a shareholder in MPAC since 2013 when it was known as Molins.\nAdam has enjoyed a varied engineering career, initially working in space technology, then with Rolls Royce and for JCB before joining MPAC initially as COO in 2021. He has a track record of solving engineering problems in global industries and leading teams that provide after-sales care for large multinational customers.\nAdam gives us a detailed run-through of the rich legacy of the business he now runs and its evolution into an automation systems provider to the global packaging industry.

It is a fascinating read.\nIn today\u2019s conversation, Patrick discusses how mechanistic economics leads to damaging policy errors, how mechanistic investment strategies damage price discovery, and the amazing overlapping worlds of markets and minds. In short, Patrick believes markets are conscious and we would be better off if we established this as our way of framing how we think about economics and finance.\nAs Patrick says, if mainstream economics is the answer to our problems, then we are asking the wrong questions. And that the growing dominance of mechanistic and passive investment flows risk breaking markets' conscious means of price and value discovery.\nPatrick\u2019s analysis contains much practical guidance on thinking about real and financial markets, although he concedes that more research is required.\nPlease enjoy my conversation with the maverick thinker, Patrick Schotanus.\n\nBrought to you by Progressive Equity ( https://progressive-research.com/ ).\n\nIn the Company of Mavericks \nEpisode 31\nMarch 8, 2024\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/798dbf62\n\n\u2605 Additional episodes: http://www.inthecompanyofmavericks.com"

Originally on Twitter and now on Substack, Doomberg has become the most popular financial newsletter on the platform.\nDoomberg explains why he has chosen to operate anonymously, helping him explore and explain complex and technical aspects of the energy debate with unusual clarity often overlooked or ignored by mainstream media and policymakers.\nIn this fascinating discussion, Doomberg explains why energy is fundamental to human life, why our dizzying technical expertise in extracting hydrocarbons is overlooked and even denigrated by people whose very lives depend on it, what the connection is between energy and human flourishing, how our thinking has been held hostage by Malthusian beliefs of pessimism leading to energy crises, economic decline and political unrest. We also talk about the recent COP 28 gathering and the renewed pursuit of nuclear energy.\nI have learnt much from Doomberg about energy, economics and how our world works. In so doing, he demonstrates the changing nature of our media and how the internet can be used as a force for an informed debate on important topics. I find his approach refreshing and inspiring.\nPlease enjoy my conversation with the maverick Doomberg.\n\nBrought to you by Progressive Equity Research.

With his questioning and observations, James brings to life the investment case for what one might believe to be an overly competitive and low-value-added business.\nThis episode offers a fascinating insight into a man with a passion for carpet distribution and the views of a professional investor backing him to succeed.

He discusses the difficulties of attracting outside shareholders and how modern norms of PLC life often run counter to the cherished traditions of personal relationships often prevalent in family-owned companies.\nEdward is not a first-generation entrepreneur managing growth and holding a tiger by the tail. First and foremost, he is trying to preserve capital and generate income for an increasingly dispersed group of family and friends while meeting the requirements of a modern listed company.\nDespite navigating the financing pitfalls of the global financial crisis and the COVID pandemic, Town Centre Securities is left today as something of a stock market relic, trading at less than half its assessed net asset value, reflecting its small size and lack of institutional appeal.\nAs Edward says, running a small listed family business is exciting and depressing in equal measure.\n\nIn the Company of Mavericks \nEpisode 20\nOctober 18, 2023\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/53245e2e\n\n\u2605 Additional episodes: http://www.inthecompanyofmavericks.com"

However, James has his own very distinctive approach to investing.\u00a0\nDavid and I have attended the Phoenix Annual Investor Meetings together for the last couple of years and have been impressed by James\u2019 presentations of his top picks, last year of French champagne house Laurent Perrier and this year's US onshore gas producer CNX.\u00a0\nJames talks about his investment philosophy, why he seeks to invest in leaders rather than managers and the difference leaders can have on their organisations. He gives us insights into what he regards as the hidden value in three companies covering the French luxury goods industry, the US natural gas market, and the UK floor coverings market.\u00a0\nJames dives into his holdings in Laurent Perrier, CNX and the UK\u2019s Likewise Group.\u00a0\u00a0James leaves few stones unturned in his approach to getting insight and understanding of the companies he invests in. He gives us a masterclass in value investing, the importance of doing the work, and the insights it can yield. \u00a0\nI learnt a lot from this conversation. I hope you do too.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIn the Company of Mavericks \nEpisode 17\nMay 5, 2023\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/35d46328\n\n\u2605 Additional episodes: http://www.inthecompanyofmavericks.com"

I witnessed Sukh's passion for all aspects of the business, particularly the development of new products and production and distribution efficiency.\u00a0\nCake Box now has over 200 stores and continues to grow. Sukh believes that consumers have re-adjusted to the higher cost of living and remain prepared to spend on treats for birthdays and special occasions.\u00a0\n\n\nPlease enjoy my catch-up with the maverick, Sukh Chamdal.\n\n\n\nIn the Company of Mavericks \nEpisode 18\nMay 26, 2023\n\n\u2605 Episode details: https://share.transistor.fm/s/f699dc77\n\n\u2605 Additional episodes: http://www.inthecompanyofmavericks.com"

Kernow is a contrarian investor using fundamental analysis and catalyst-driven mean reversion investing. Alyx is a long-short investor. \u00a0\nLaurence Hulse is a Director of Dowgate Wealth. He is the fund manager of the recently launched investment company Onward Opportunities Ltd.\u00a0\nOnward Opportunities' strategy is to pursue inefficiencies in the UK market for small and micro-cap companies. It is a long-only strategy. \u00a0\nLaurence explains his background and how he fell for the style of investing, which he describes as engaged activism, using a velvet glove, not a boxing glove.\u00a0\nHe gives us examples of how this strategy has been effective in the past, and we talk about the current UK market conditions in which Laurence is launching this new vehicle.\u00a0\n\nAlyx and Laurence are maverick investors among today\u2019s market participants who are often passive trackers, index huggers, or trend followers.\u00a0\n\nThis was a fascinating discussion about how professional investors seek to outperform with strategies that Alyx describes as suiting their personalities.\u00a0\n\u00a0In Alyx\u2019s capacity as a family office manager, he describes why he likes the strategy of Onward Opportunities and how it compliments his investment style.\u00a0\nI greatly enjoyed this chat.
